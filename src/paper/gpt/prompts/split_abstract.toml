Given the paper abstract, extract the sentences that describe the paper's background
context (e.g. the task), and which describe the paper's target (e.g. methods, resources).

The output will contain two fields: `context` and `target`. For each of them, collect
the sentences of the appropriate type. The output should be the relevant sentences
combined for each type. Between the two types, all sentences in the abstract should be
covered. No sentence in the abstract should be missing from the output.
