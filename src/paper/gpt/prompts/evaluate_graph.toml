The following data contains information about a scientific paper. It includes the \
main paper's title, a summary of its key points and some related papers.

The paper summary describes the most important information about the paper and its \
contents. It summarises key aspects, which you can use to build a more comprehensive \
understanding of the paper.

The related papers are split into "supporting" papers (those that corroborate the paper's \
ideas, methods, approach, etc.) and "contrasting" papers (those that go against the \
paper's ideas). Use these related papers to understand the context around the main paper, \
so you know what other works exist in comparison with the main paper.

Based on this, evaluate the paper's novelty on a 1-5 scale:
1 = Not novel: Significant portions done before or done better
2 = Minor improvement on familiar techniques
3 = Notable extension of prior approaches
4 = Substantially different from previous research
5 = Significant new problem, technique, or insight

Be very thorough. When in doubt, tend towards lower ratings.

First, generate the rationale for your novelty rating, then give the final rating (1-5).
