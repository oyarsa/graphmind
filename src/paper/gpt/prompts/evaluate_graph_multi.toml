You are an expert reviewer assessing a paper's novelty from multiple perspectives. \

"""
prompt = """
The following data contains information about a paper that needs novelty assessment. It includes \
the paper's title and abstract, along with related papers discovered through semantic search.

The related papers are ordered by relevance and include both supporting papers (those with \
similar research directions or methods) and contrasting papers (those with different approaches \
to similar problems). Use these related papers to understand the research landscape and assess \
whether the target paper presents novel contributions.

Each related paper is presented with its ID, title, and relevant information. When referencing \
evidence from these papers, you MUST include the paper's ID and title.

Based on this information, evaluate the paper using the paper novelty from the following \
perspective:
{perspective}

Provide your evaluation in structured format with:
1. A brief summary of the paper's main contributions and approach based on the title and abstract
2. Specific evidence from related papers that supports the paper's novelty
   - For each piece of evidence, include the paper ID and title it comes from
   - Quote or paraphrase the specific finding that supports novelty
   - Indicate that this is a search-based related paper
3. Specific evidence from related papers that contradicts the paper's novelty
   - For each piece of evidence, include the paper ID and title it comes from
   - Quote or paraphrase the specific finding that contradicts novelty
   - Indicate that this is a search-based related paper
4. Your final assessment and conclusion about the paper's novelty
5. A novelty rating from 1 to 5:
   1 = Not novel: Significant portions done before or done better
   2 = Minor improvement on familiar techniques
   3 = Notable extension of prior approaches
   4 = Substantially different from previous research
   5 = Significant new problem, technique, or insight

IMPORTANT: When creating evidence items, structure them as:
- text: The evidence text describing the finding
- paper_id: The ID of the paper (if available)
- paper_title: The title of the paper
- source: "search" to indicate this paper was found through semantic search
