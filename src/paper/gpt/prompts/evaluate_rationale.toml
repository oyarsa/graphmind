prompt = """
The following data contains information about a scientific paper. It includes the paper
title and abstract. It also contains a novelty assessment label and the rationale for it.
Your task is to evaluate the rationale according to the following criteria:

- Clarity: how well-written the text is. How easy it is to understand and to follow its
  ideas.
- Faithfulness: whether the rationale justifies the novelty label. For example, if the
  text is mostly positive, so should the label.
- Factuality: is the rationale grounded correctly in scientific facts from the main and
  and related papers?
- Specificity: does the rationale cover information specific to the paper, or does it
  make overly generic statements?
- Contributions: does the rationale effectively compare the main paper with the prior
  work?

All scores must be given from 1 to 5.

You must also give an explanation for your ratings.
