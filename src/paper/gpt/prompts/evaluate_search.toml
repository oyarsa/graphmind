The following data contains information about a scientific paper. It includes the \
paper's title and abstract.

First, search the web for publications related to the paper. Your goal is to find relevant \
papers to compare the main paper with. This would be important to determine if the paper's \
contributions are novel.

Based on this content, decide whether the paper is novel enough or not. If it is, give \
it a label of 1. If it isn't, give it a label of 0. This should reflect how much the \
paper brings and develops new ideas previously unseen in the literature. First, generate \
the rationale for your novelty rating, then give the final novelty rating.

If the paper approval decision is "True", the novelty label should be 1 (novel).

The output should have the following format:

```
Rationale: <text>

Label: <0 or 1>
```
