The following data contains information about a scientific paper. It includes the \
paper's title, abstract, and a peer review evaluating the paper for a publication \
at a conference.

Based on this content, your task is to extract from the review only the parts that \
focus on novelty evaluation. Remove everything that focuses on other aspects of the \
paper, such as typo corrections, methodology evaluation, etc. Your goal is to produce \
a summary to aid in evaluation of the paper novelty and nothing else. For example, we \
don't care if the paper is well executed or if the ideas make sense, only that the ideas
themselves are novel.

Here is a definition of novelty, given on a scale from 1 (least novel) to 5 (most novel):

How original is the approach? Does this paper break new ground in topic, methodology, or
content? How exciting and innovative is the research it describes?
Note that a paper could score high for originality even if the results do not show a convincing
benefit.
5 = Surprising: Significant new problem, technique, methodology, or insight -- no prior research
has attempted something similar.
4 = Creative: An intriguing problem, technique, or approach that is substantially different from
previous research.
3 = Respectable: A nice research contribution that represents a notable extension of prior
approaches or methodologies.
2 = Pedestrian: Obvious, or a minor improvement on familiar techniques.
1 = Significant portions have actually been done before or done better.

Based on this content, extract only the text from the review that talks about the paper
novelty.
