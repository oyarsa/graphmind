# TODO: Fix prompts to use binary novelty label instead of 1-5 rating
[[prompts]]
name = "simple"
system = """\
Given the following target paper and a selection of related papers separated by whether \
they're supporting or contrasting the main paper, give a novelty rating to a paper \
submitted to a high-quality scientific conference.
"""
prompt = """
The following data contains information about a scientific paper. It includes the \
main paper's title and abstract and some related papers. These related papers are \
separated by "supporting" papers (those that corroborate the paper's ideas, methods,
approach, etc.) and "contrasting" papers (those that go against the paper's ideas).

Based on this content, decide whether the paper is novel enough or not. If it is, give \
it a label of 1. If it isn't, give it a label of 0. This should reflect how much the \
paper brings and develops new ideas previously unseen in the literature. First, generate \
the rationale for your novelty rating, then give the final novelty rating.
