The following data contains information about a scientific paper. It includes the main paper's title, a summary of its key points and some related papers.

The paper summary describes the most important information about the paper and its contents. It summarises key aspects, which you can use to build a more comprehensive understanding of the paper.

The related papers are split into "supporting" papers (those that corroborate the paper's ideas, methods, approach, etc.) and "contrasting" papers (those that go against the paper's ideas). Use these related papers to understand the context around the main paper, so you know what other works exist in comparison with the main paper.

Based on this content, assign the paper a novelty rating from 1 to 5. This rating should reflect how much the paper brings and develops new ideas previously unseen in the literature. First, generate the rationale for your novelty rating, then give the final novelty rating.
