Paper summary:
This paper is titled 'IMPROVING NEURAL LANGUAGE MODELS WITH A CONTINUOUS CACHE'. It's about representation learning for computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities. The key contributions are:

1. Neural Cache Model improves language model performance: The proposed Neural Cache Model significantly outperforms recent memory augmented networks on several language model datasets by efficiently adapting to recent history. This is done with:
  1.1. Neural Cache Model: A continuous version of the cache model that stores recent hidden activations as memory and uses them for prediction through a dot product with the current hidden activation. It requires no training and can be used on any pre-trained neural networks. This method is validated by these experiments:
    1.1.1. Small Scale Experiments on Penn Tree Bank and wikitext2: Evaluated the Neural Cache Model on small datasets like Penn Tree Bank and wikitext2, showing competitive performance with state-of-the-art models and significant improvements with larger cache sizes.
    1.1.2. Medium Scale Experiments on text8 and wikitext103: Tested the Neural Cache Model on medium scale datasets text8 and wikitext103, demonstrating the model's ability to exploit larger cache sizes and improve perplexity over LSTM baselines.
    1.1.3. Experiments on the LAMBADA dataset: Conducted experiments on the LAMBADA dataset, where the Neural Cache Model significantly improved performance over LSTM baselines, highlighting its ability to handle long-term context.

2. Neural Cache Model is computationally efficient: The Neural Cache Model scales to very large memory sizes with negligible computational cost, unlike traditional memory-augmented networks. This is done with:
  2.1.
