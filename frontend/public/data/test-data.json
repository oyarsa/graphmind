To address these problems, this work employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as a decision-making component for complex AD scenarios that require human commonsense understanding. We devise cognitive pathways to enable comprehensive reasoning with LLMs, and develop algorithms for translating LLM decisions into actionable driving commands. Through this approach, LLM decisions are seamlessly integrated with low-level controllers by guided parameter matrix adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method not only consistently surpasses baseline approaches in single-vehicle tasks, but also helps handle complex driving behaviors even multi-vehicle coordination, thanks to the commonsense reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This paper presents an initial step toward leveraging LLMs as effective decision-makers for intricate AD scenarios in terms of safety, efficiency, generalizability, and interoperability.

We aspire for it to serve as inspiration for future research in this field.","authors":["Hao Sha","Yao Mu","Yuxuan Jiang","Guojian Zhan","Li Chen","Chenfeng Xu","Ping Luo","Shengbo Eben Li","Masayoshi Tomizuka","Wei Zhan","Mingyu Ding"],"sections":[{"heading":"Introduction","text":"# Introduction\n\nImagine you are behind the wheel, approaching an unsignalized intersection and planning to turn left, with an oncoming vehicle straight ahead. Human drivers intuitively know that according to traffic rules, they should slow down and yield, even if it is technically possible to speed through. However, existing advanced learning-based Autonomous Driving (AD) systems typically require complex rules or reward function designs to handle such scenarios effectively [@10138317; @9351818]. This reliance on predefined rule bases often limits their ability to generalize to various situations.\n\nAnother challenge facing existing learning-based AD systems is the long-tail problem [@9022290]. Both limited datasets and sampling efficiency [@atakishiyev2023explainable] can present challenges for existing learning-based AD systems when making decisions in rare real-world driving scenarios. Chauffeurnet [@bansal2018chauffeurnet] demonstrated such limits where even 30 million state-action samples were insufficient to learn an optimal policy that mapped bird's-eye view images (states) to control (action).\n\nFurthermore, the lack of interpretability [@gohel2021explainable] is a pressing issue for existing learning-based AD systems. A mature AD system must possess interpretability to gain recognition within society and regulatory entities, allowing it to be subject to targeted optimization and iterative improvements. Nevertheless, existing learning-based AD systems inherently resemble black boxes, making it challenging to discern their decision-making processes or understand the rationale behind their actions [@atakishiyev2023explainable]. This lack of transparency can pose obstacles to the practical implementation of AD systems.\n\nConsidering the aforementioned challenges, a fundamental question arises: *Can we equip AD systems with the capability to think and drive like humans?* Our proposed solution involves employing a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the \\\"brain\\\" of the AD system. Recent introductions of models like ChatGPT [@chatgpt], have positioned LLMs as early versions of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) [@bubeck2023sparks], owing to their remarkable emergent abilities [@wei2022emergent] and innovative techniques such as Instruct Following and In-Context Learning (ICL) [@dong2023survey]. LLMs can think like humans [@fu2023drive], and reason about new scenarios by combining common sense, and the visible thinking process makes them strongly interpretable. These features make LLMs a powerful solution to the problems faced by AD systems described above.\n\n![Faced with the rare situation where a breakdown vehicle is stopped in the middle of the road in a roundabout, LLM makes a decision that complies with traffic rules through common sense reasoning and understanding of high-level information.](figure/fig1.png){#fig:fig1}\n\nIn this paper, we leverage LLMs to analyze and reason about various scenarios, enabling it to provide high-level decisions, and by tuning parameter matrix, we convert high-level decisions into mathematical representations to guide the bottom-level controller, Model Predictive Control (MPC).

In advanced tasks with LLMs, the translation of natural language input into actionable results is crucial. One prominent task is language-to-actions mapping, which has seen early approaches leveraging frameworks like temporal logic [@kress2008translating] and motion primitive learning [@matuszek2013learning], evolving towards more recent end-to-end models for instruction-following in navigation [@ku2020room; @kamath2023new] and manipulation tasks, employing latent embeddings of language commands [@jang2021bc; @mees23hulc2; @lynch2022interactive].

However, [@chen2023driving] lacks the capability to translate reasoning into actionable driving maneuvers. [@fu2023drive] solves this issue, but the high-level safety judgments and decision-making processes rely on fixed rules rather than harnessing the full potential of LLMs' advanced reasoning capabilities. In this work, we aim to develop an AD system where LLMs play a central role in high-level decision-making. We extend their application to more intricate scenarios, such as navigating intersections and roundabouts, providing an initial step towards unlocking LLMs' effectiveness as decision-makers for complex AD scenarios."},{"heading":"Method","text":"# Method\n\nWe develop an AD system with LLM as the core of high-level decision-making, as shown in Fig. [\\[fig:chain\\]](#fig:chain){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:chain\"}. The LLM initiates a dialogue based on the provided prompt, continuously gathering information from the environment, engaging in reasoning, and rendering judgments. As illustrated in the center of Fig. [\\[fig:chain\\]](#fig:chain){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:chain\"}, from left to right, the LLM proceeds sequentially: 1) identifies the vehicles requiring attention, 2)evaluates the situation, and 3) offers action guidance. Then the system transforms these three high-level textual decisions into mathematical representations, namely the observation matrix, weight matrix, and action bias. These elements serve as directives for the bottom-level controller, the MPC, instructing it on specific driving actions to be taken.\n\nTaking the case of a left turn at an intersection as an example, in Fig. [\\[fig:matrix\\]](#fig:matrix){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:matrix\"} we show how the three high-level textual decisions described above can be converted into the mathematical representations needed for MPC. The LLM selects 'vehicle_26', and we create a corresponding vector using the MPC's observation operator and zero out other elements in the observation matrix to focus solely on 'vehicle_26'. According to the waiting situation at the intersection that the LLM signals, we adjust the weight matrix to prioritize deceleration instructions over trajectory following, which prompts the MPC to decelerate promptly in alignment with the LLM's directive. We directly convert LLM's action guidance into action bias through predefined rules. Guided by the mathematical form of the above three aspects, the MPC completes the driving action of stopping and yielding.\n\n## Background\n\nThe MPC solves a finite-time open-loop optimization problem online at each moment, based on the current measurement information obtained, and applies the first element of the resulting control sequence with the lowest cost to the controlled vehicle.\n\nIn this work, we define the cost function of MPC in the context of Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is commonly used to formulate vehicle control problems: $(S, A, C, P, p_0)$, where $S$ is the state space, $A$ is the action space, $C: S \\times A \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}$ is the cost function, $P: S \\times A \\mapsto S$ is the dynamics equation, and $p_0$ is the initial state distribution. Given a cost function $C$, the MPC finds a sequence of actions $\\mathbf{a}_{1:H} ={ \\mathbf{a}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{a}_H}$ that minimizes the expected accumulated cost $\\small J(\\mathbf{a}_{1:H}) = \\sum_{t=1}^{H} C(\\mathbf{s}_t, \\mathbf{a}_t)$. The cost function takes the following form: $$\\begin{gathered}\n\\small\nC(\\mathbf{s}, \\mathbf{a}) = \\sum_{i = 0}^M w_i \\cdot \\textrm{n}_i\\big(r_i(\\mathbf{s}, \\mathbf{a}, \\psi_i)\\big),\n\\end{gathered}$$ where $w \\in \\mathbb{R}{+}$ is a non-negative weight, $\\textrm{n}(\\cdot) : \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}+$ is a twice-differentiable norm that takes its minimum at 0, $r \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a residual term that achieves optimality when $r=0$, and $\\psi_i$ is the parameters of the $i^\\text{th}$ residual term. For example, if we want the vehicle to adopt the desired acceleration, we may design a residual term $r_{acc}(acc, \\psi) = acc-\\psi$, where the cost parameter $\\psi$ denotes the desired acceleration, and use the $\\ell_2$ norm to construct the final reward function: $C_{acc} = w |r_{acc}|_2$. Due to the complexity of driving scenarios, designing a set of weights and residual terms that are applicable to all driving scenarios is almost impossible [@unknown]. In this work, we use a generic and simple set of residual terms that include action biases to tune the control behavior, and design multiple sets of weight matrixes based on the certainty that the MPC should perform the action biases. We use the power of LLM to give action bias and select weight matrices for driving in complex scenarios.\n\n<figure id=\"fig:pipeline\">\n\n<figcaption>(a) Pipeline of our system with LLM as the core of high-level decision-making. (b) The LLM textual high-level decisions are converted into mathematical representations that guide the MPC to give specific driving actions. Take the case of a left turn at an intersection as an example.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## Chain-of-thought\n\n![Prompts for the three core tools we have defined. Each tool's prompt contains both information and guidelines to help LLM complete reasoning and judgment and begin the next step.](figure/prompt.png){#fig:prompt}\n\nWe employ LangChain [@langchain] as a framework to manage the LLM and establish a structured thought process for the LLM. This is achieved by defining a set of tools and specifying the sequence in which they should be utilized. To begin, we introduce these designated tools in a prompt at the outset of the conversation. Subsequently, during the course of the dialogue, the LLM actively invokes these tools to acquire pertinent information and guidance for its ongoing decision-making process. The LLM follows these guidelines to determine its next course of action until it successfully addresses the entire problem.\n\nAs an illustrative example, let's consider the three core tools depicted in Fig. [3](#fig:prompt){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:prompt\"}. Each of these tools serves the dual purpose of providing the LLM with the relevant information and reasoning guidelines necessary to complete a specific reasoning step, while also directing the LLM on what actions it should take next.\n\nMoreover, these tools enable us to revamp the way we deliver scenario information. Instead of overwhelming the LLM with all the scenario details at once, we provide only the relevant information needed for each decision step in the LLM's thought process, as depicted in Fig. [3](#fig:prompt){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:prompt\"}. This approach represents a strategic shift that tackles a significant challenge faced by the LLM when dealing with complex and extensive data. It ensures that information is organized for simplicity and necessity, leading to a substantial improvement in the LLM's ability to reason and exercise judgment.\n\n## Attention Allocation {#sec:attention}\n\nThe ability to effectively distribute attention while driving reflects a human-like thought process. In this context, we task the LLM with systematically assessing information pertaining to surrounding vehicles, one at a time. Its objective is to discern the intentions of these vehicles and, ultimately, determine if they pose any conflicts with the movements of the ego vehicle. Specifically, At time $t$, for each element of surrounding vehicles $\\mathcal{V}^t=\\left\\{V_1^t,\\ V_2^t,\\ \\ldots\\right\\}$, we have: $$\\begin{gathered}\nI_i^t = {\\rm LLM}(S_i^t,\\ S_i^{t-1},\\ \\ldots,\\ S_i^{t-10},\\ env^t),\\\\\nM_i^t = {\\rm LLM}(S_i^t,\\ I_i^t,\\ env^t),\n\\end{gathered}$$ where $env^t$ is the scene road information, $S_i^t$ is the state of $V_i^t$ obtained from the environment, $I_i^t$ is the intention of $V_i^t$, and $M_i^t$ is 0 or 1, indicating whether the $V_i^t$ is considered by the LLM to be of concern. Subsequently, we create an observation matrix for the MPC exclusively based on the vehicles identified by the LLM: $$\\begin{gathered}\nobs_i^t = {\\rm MPC_{obs}}(S_i^t,\\ I_i^t,\\ env^t) * M_i^t,\n\\end{gathered}$$ where $obs_i^t$ is row $i$ of the MPC observation matrix, $\\rm MPC_{obs}$ is the operator for MPC to compute the observation matrix. This ensures that the MPC focuses solely on these selected vehicles.\n\n## Situation Awareness and Action Guidance\n\nSituation awareness stands as a pivotal high-level decision-making process in driving, encompassing a profound understanding of the scenario at hand, along with common-sense reasoning. Within this framework, we tasked the LLM with the responsibility of selecting one specific situation from among several options, leveraging the information gleaned during the attention allocation process outlined in Section [3.3](#sec:attention){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:attention\"}, as well as the results of the LLM's reasoned judgments. We define the feature $F_i^t=\\left\\{S_i^t,\\ I_i^t,\\ M_i^t\\right\\}$ to characterize the information associated with $V_i^t$, then we have: $$\\begin{gathered}\nX^t = {\\rm LLM}(F_1^t,\\ \\ldots,\\ F_k^t,\\ env^t),\n\\end{gathered}$$ where $k$ is the number of surrounding vehicles selected by LLM, and $X^t$ is the selected situation. The judgment of $X^t$ serves as a mechanism to tune the weight matrix of the MPC. For each predefined situation, we have established a corresponding weight matrix $W^t$. Subsequently, the LLM provided guidance concerning acceleration and steering based on its chosen situation: $$\\begin{gathered}\nA^t = {\\rm LLM}(F_1^t,\\ \\ldots,\\ F_k^t,\\ env^t,\\ X^t),\n\\end{gathered}$$ where $A^t$ is action guidance. The $A^t$ influences the adjustment of the MPC's action bias, with costs decreasing as the vehicle's actions align more closely with the provided guidance: $$\\begin{gathered}\nr_{bias}(bias,\\ \\psi) = bias-\\psi, \\\\\nC_{bias} = w_{bias} |r_{bias}|_2,\n\\end{gathered}$$ where $bias$ is acceleration or steering. It's worth noting that our set of predefined situations, though limited in number, are abstract and broad enough to encompass a wide range of driving scenarios, as they do not represent specific scenarios, but rather the certainty that the MPC should perform the action biases. We substantiate the effectiveness of this approach through experimental validation in Section [4.1](#sec:single){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:single\"}.\n\n## Multi-vehicle Joint Control\n\nMulti-vehicle joint control is an important solution for improving transportation efficiency and safety. However, both centralized and distributed approaches are often overly reliant on environmental prior and fail to exhibit good performance when the traffic model is unknown [@10172912]. To address this problem, we propose a solution. Each vehicle is individually controlled by a distributed LLM, with one central LLM acting as the \\\"brain\\\" of the fleet for multi-vehicle communication and coordination. Each distributed LLM reports the situation it is into the central LLM and receives commands to control the ego vehicle; the central LLM judges and gives the coordination commands based on the environmental information and the reports from the distributed LLMs.\n\n[]{#tab:t1 label=\"tab:t1\"}"},{"heading":"Experiments","text":"# Experiments\n\nOur approach was applied to both single-vehicle decision-making and multi-vehicle joint control tasks. The scenario maps and traffic flows were generated using the IdSim [@2021arXiv210910557L].\n\nIn the context of single-vehicle decision-making, we conducted evaluations over three different approaches: Reinforcement Learning-Based Planning (RL) [@9760270; @9857655], Model Predictive Control (MPC) [@9760270], and our system, MPC with LLM's High-Level Decision-Making Guidelines (LLM+MPC). Among them, RL was trained and validated in a wide range of complex traffic scenarios, and MPC was finely tuned and validated in real-vehicle experiments. Each of these approaches was tested across diverse scenarios, including signalized intersections, unsignalized intersections, driveways, emergency avoidance, and roundabouts. We selected 25 complex and challenging cases for each scenario type to comprehensively assess system performance. Evaluation metrics are detailed in Appendix [6](#app:metrics){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"app:metrics\"}. Furthermore, We have also demonstrated the great potential of our system in driving behavior modulation guided by textual input, demonstrating its excellent understanding of high-level information.\n\nIn the realm of multi-vehicle joint control, our method's capabilities were put to the test in intricate gaming scenarios. Notably, we evaluated its performance in complex situations like narrow lane meetings, showcasing its adaptability and effectiveness in challenging environments.\n\n## Single-vehicle Decision-making {#sec:single}\n\nThe quantitative results of single-vehicle decision-making are shown in Table [\\[tab:t1\\]](#tab:t1){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"tab:t1\"}. It's important to highlight that our system achieves overall cost reductions across four scenario types, reflecting improved driving behavior. In non-emergency situations, we observe minimal fail occurrences and no collisions, underlining the safety of our approach. Additionally, in emergency scenarios, our method significantly lowers the accident rate, indicating its effectiveness in obstacle avoidance.\n\nSpecifically, in intersections, our focus is primarily on left-turn situations, where ego vehicle inherently possesses a lower right-of-way status, necessitating a deliberate choice to slow down and yield in accordance with established traffic rules. In left-turning within the intersections scenarios and roundabouts scenarios, although our approach may result in a slight increase in elapsed time, it yields substantial benefits in terms of enhanced traffic flow efficiency and reduced safety penalties. This outcome underscores our method's commitment to adopting safer and more reasonable driving behaviors that align with the principles of traffic regulations. In lanes, our approach excels in all metrics, indicating a more sensible approach to overtaking and lane changes. Finally, in emergency situations, our method demonstrates its effectiveness by reducing accident rates and enhancing overall performance.\n\n![The ego vehicle is traveling straight through an unsignalized intersection. The red vehicle(s) in the last row is the one(s) selected by the LLM as needing attention. This example demonstrates LLM's understanding and reasoning about high-level information, proving the validity of the chain-of-thought we devised.](figure/single.png){#fig:cross_straight}\n\n**Attention Allocation.** Fig. [4](#fig:cross_straight){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:cross_straight\"} illustrates a scenario where the ego vehicle is proceeding straight through an unsignalized intersection. In this situation, the MPC incorporates all surrounding vehicles into its observation matrix for prediction and trajectory planning. However, it becomes evident from the outcomes that the MPC fails to accurately discern that \\\"vehicle_32\\\" has a lower right-of-way priority, erroneously decelerates and maneuvers to avoid it. In contrast, our approach, which employs LLM's reasoning, effectively comprehends the intention of \\\"vehicle_32.\\\" As a result, it concentrates its attention solely on the foremost vehicle that could impact the ego vehicle's motion and appropriately follows it as it navigates the intersection. This example serves as a compelling demonstration of how the LLM in our approach adeptly comprehends the traffic scenario and discerns the intentions of other vehicles. This enables it to make more informed decisions about allocating attention and, consequently, facilitates more efficient and rational driving behavior.\n\n**Situation Awareness and Action Guidance.** In the scenario depicted in Fig. [4](#fig:cross_straight){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:cross_straight\"}, a crucial factor to consider is that the ego vehicle, despite being hindered by the slower-moving vehicle ahead, is obligated by traffic regulations not to perform overtaking maneuvers within the intersection. However, the RL opts to overtake the leading vehicle from the right side immediately within the intersection. This decision stems from the inherent limitations of learning-based approaches, which often struggle to grasp high-level information such as traffic regulations. Their primary focus tends to be on achieving a certain level of efficiency and safety in driving. In contrast, our approach, as indicated in the dialogue box on the right, showcases the LLM's capacity to accurately comprehend the ego vehicle's situation. It makes a reasoned choice to follow the vehicle ahead through the intersection before considering an overtaking maneuver, which aligns with traffic regulations. This example underscores the LLM's proficiency in reasoning about complex traffic scenarios and assessing its own circumstances. As a result, it produces decisions that closely mimic human thinking, guided by higher-level information like traffic regulations and common sense.\n\n**Ablations.** We conducted ablation experiments in two typical driving scenarios, unsignalized intersections, and roundabouts, and the outcomes are presented in Table [\\[tab:t2\\]](#tab:t2){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"tab:t2\"}. When solely employing the LLM's Attention Allocation capability, nearly all metrics exhibited improvement compared to the baseline MPC. This improvement stemmed from the system's ability to disregard irrelevant surrounding vehicles, leading to more effective decision-making. On the other hand, when utilizing only the LLM Situation Awareness and Action Guidance features, all metrics, except for time, demonstrated substantial enhancement compared to the baseline MPC. This highlights the pivotal role played by our system's comprehension of high-level information in decision-making.\n\n[]{#tab:t2 label=\"tab:t2\"}\n\n## Multi-vehicle Joint Control\n\n<figure>\n\n<figcaption>(a) The convoy is in a meeting situation. This example demonstrates that the high-level decision-making of the central LLM and the fine-grained control of the distributed LLMs collaborate to accomplish high-quality multi-vehicle cooperative control. (b) LLM changes lanes to avoid road construction under textual guidance.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWe have assessed the effectiveness of our approach through a specific scenario involving a narrow road encounter, as depicted in Fig. [\\[fig:multi\\]](#fig:multi){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:multi\"}. In this scenario, two distributed LLMs concurrently report that they are in a meeting situation. The central LLM, informed by the scenario details and the self-assessment of each distributed LLM, issues instructions. One vehicle is instructed to decelerate and wait, while the other is advised to slow down and proceed, thus facilitating communication and coordination within the convoy. Subsequently, each distributed LLM adjusts the control of its respective vehicle in accordance with this convoy-level decision. This example vividly illustrates how our system combines the strengths of both centralized and distributed methodologies. The central LLM acts as the \\\"brain\\\" for convoy communication and coordination, while distributed LLMs can intelligently manage their respective vehicles based on decisions made at the convoy level.\n\n## Text-modulated Driving Behavior\n\n![The ego vehicle is traveling in lane, the front vehicle is slow, and the ego vehicle overtaking would be low risk. This example demonstrates the ease and effectiveness of LLM in driving style adjustment.](figure/style.png){#fig:style}\n\n**Driving style adjustment.** In real-world driving scenarios, users often desire the ability to effortlessly customize the driving behavior of AD systems to align with their preferences for efficiency and comfort. However, for learning-based or optimization-based AD systems, achieving this level of intuitive and reliable customization requires complex rule or reward function designs [@chang2023editing]. In contrast, our approach simplifies the process by merely providing textual descriptions to the LLM through a dedicated interface. Fig. [5](#fig:style){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:style\"} exemplifies this feature. When there is low risk of overtaking, LLM instructed to drive aggressively will make reasonable overtaking decisions, while those directed to drive conservatively will opt to slow down and follow the vehicle in front of it. This example effectively illustrates how our approach excels at comprehending the user's abstract and non-intuitive requirements, easily delivering the expected driving behavior.\n\n**Textual guidance for complex scenarios.** Certain complex transportation scenarios, such as road construction and other uncommon situations, pose significant challenges for many existing AD systems [@10138317]. However, these scenarios are typically straightforward for humans to identify and understand. To address this issue, our approach enables users or utilizes high-precision maps to provide textual instructions that guide the AD system's decision-making process. As depicted in Fig. [\\[fig:txt\\]](#fig:txt){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"fig:txt\"}, we conducted an experiment involving a road construction scenario. Upon receiving textual guidelines, our approach successfully recognized the situation and gave appropriate driving behavior."},{"heading":"Conclusion","text":"# Conclusion\n\nThis paper demonstrates that LLMs can effectively serve as the core high-level decision-making component of AD systems.

This paper makes a compelling case for LLMs as a transformative solution to enable human-like performance in diverse driving scenarios. Our approach provides an initial step for developing safe, efficient, generalizable, and interpretable LLM-based AD systems. We aspire for it to serve as inspiration for future research in this domain."},{"heading":"Metrics","text":"# Metrics {#app:metrics}\n\nWe use the metrics below to measure the safety and efficiency of driving behavior.\n\n**Number of failure/collision cases:** We keep a tally of failure cases. A case is marked as a failure if the ego vehicle cannot reach its target area within a designated 200-second time frame. For clarity, when the ego vehicle travels within a lane, the target area is defined as the end of that lane. When it navigates through an intersection or roundabout, the target area is set as the beginning of the target lane. Collision cases are tracked separately.\n\n**Inefficiency:** To gauge the efficiency of traffic flow, we calculate the average difference between the ego vehicle's maximum and current speeds: $$\\begin{gathered}\n\\xi = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^N (v_i^{max}-v_i).\n\\end{gathered}$$ Our assessment focuses solely on the lead vehicle within each convoy, as it is the one directly influenced by the ego vehicle's driving behavior. Vehicles affected by red lights are excluded from this calculation.\n\n**Time:** We directly record the time the ego vehicle takes to reach its target area. This metric serves as an indicator of the ego vehicle's driving efficiency.\n\n**Penalty:** The penalty metric is employed to assess the safety of the ego vehicle's driving behavior. It's computed based on the distance between the target vehicle and the ego vehicle, as well as the deceleration of the target vehicle. Smaller distances and higher decelerations indicate more unsafe driving behavior, thus contributing to a higher penalty: $$P_{dec} = w_{dec}\\sum_{i = 1}^N {\\rm f_{dec}}(dec_i - dec_0),$$ $$P_{dist} = w_{dist}\\sum_{i = 1}^N {\\rm f_{dist}}(dist_0 - dist_i,\\ dec_i - dec_0),$$ $$\\ {\\rm f_{dec}}(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n0& \\text{if } x \\leq 0,\\\\\nx& \\text{if } x > 0,\n\\end{cases}\n\\;\n{\\rm f_{dist}}(x, y) =\n\\begin{cases}\n0& \\text{if } y \\leq 0,\\\\\nx& \\text{if } y > 0,\n\\end{cases}$$ where $dec$ refers to decceleration, $dist$ refers to distance, $w_{dec}=100$, $w_{dist}=1$, $dec_0=1m/s^2$, and $dist_0=50m$.This penalty is calculated for each vehicle, similar to the Efficiency metric, and then aggregated to derive the final penalty score.\n\n**Cost:** To provide an overall evaluation, we apply weighted values to the above metrics so that the values of each item are close to each other: $$\\begin{gathered}\nCost = 30 * \\xi + t + 50 * P_{dec} + 5 * P_{dist}.\n\\end{gathered}$$ This comprehensive cost assessment enables us to holistically evaluate the performance of our autonomous vehicle system."},{"heading":"Decision-making Process","text":"# Decision-making Process\n\n<figure>\n\n<figcaption>Pink one is the ego vehicle, green ones are the vehicles within the perception range of the ego vehicle, blue ones are the vehicles outside the perception range of the ego vehicle, and red one is the vehicle chosen by the LLM.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe complete decision-making process of LLM is shown in the text box below.

The authors evaluate their driving pipeline in both single-vehicle tasks and multi-vehicle coordination. Results show that their method consistently surpasses baselines.\n\nStrengths: 1. Combining LLM and MPC is a smart way to leverage the high-level reasoning capability of LLM. Since LLM is not good at low-level control as shown in previous literature, using MPC to output low-level actions helps incorporate strong prior knowledge into the whole pipeline.\n\n2. Rare and long-tail events put great challenges to data-driven algorithms. Using common sense to solve such long-tail problems is a promising way. Since LLM already contains a lot of common sense, this paper is a good attempt to explore this direction.\n\n3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. Figure 2 provides a clear illustration of the entire pipeline, which makes me easy to understand the method proposed in this paper.\n\nWeaknesses: 1. A common question for LLM-based agents is the trustworthiness. When used for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, the requirements for safety are much higher than QA or code generation tasks. As far as I know, GPT3.5 and GPT4 have uncontrollable randomness even with temperature = 0. Does this randomness influence the running results? How to ensure that LLM always outputs reasonable results. Are the results consistent if the version of the ChatGPT model changes?\n\n2. How about the running frequency of the entire system? Since driving requires a high frequency to make decisions, the speed of processing the information with language may not be fast enough. This is one of the biggest challenges of using LLM for driving, which may be unaffordable and unsolvable with a general-purpose LLM. Using LLM which can only communicate with downstream modules with language wastes a lot of time on extracting information.\n\n3. In the first paragraph of the introduction, the authors provide an example “Human drivers intuitively know that according to traffic rules, they should slow down and yield, even if it is technically possible to speed through”. This example is confusing to me as it just shows two types of common driving styles of human drivers (aggressive and conservative styles). I am not aware of any complex rules or reward functions here since it is easy to force the driving algorithm to be conservative with some simple rules. Actually, considering the complexity of the pipeline designed in Figure 2, I am not sure which one is more complex. Maybe several simple cost functions in an MPC can already solve the scenarios in the experiment part.\n\n4. It seems that one important motivation for using LLM for driving is solving rare and long-tail events. However, I only find Figure 1 discusses one specific case where a breakdown vehicle is stopped in the middle of the road in a roundabout. I can’t find any evidence or experiment results showing that LLM broadly solves long-tail problems. \n\n5. In the evaluation part, only one RL algorithm (not mentioned which algorithm exactly) and one MPC are compared. Since modern AV algorithms are usually complex, I don’t think such a comparison is not convincing enough to demonstrate the advantage of the LLM method.\n\nQuestions: 1.\tCould the authors report the running time of all methods in the experiments? \n2.\tThere are 5 scenarios mentioned in Table 1 but no detailed explanation of them. I cannot evaluate the realism and difficulty of them.\n3.\tCould the authors explain more about the interpretability of the LLM method? Does this interpretability mean the reason for decision-making? Why is such interpretability useful and can we always trust such interpretability? If the interpretability is something shown in Figure 1, I think all collision avoidance algorithms can provide the reason for the decision.","rationale_pred":"Paper Summary: The paper 'LanguageMPC: Large Language Models as Decision Makers for Autonomous Driving' presents a novel approach to autonomous driving by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) as decision-making components.

However, the substantial inference latency of these LLMs has emerged as a significant obstacle bounding their broader application in scenarios with restricted computational resources. This latency primarily originates from the auto-regressive token-by-token decoding process wherein decoding $K$ tokens requires $K$ serial runs of LLMs, incurring exacerbated latency with both the length of generated tokens and the model scale.\n\n![An overview of speculative decoding (the upper part) and our PEARL(the lower part). SD employs a draft model to provide multiple drafts and then the target model verifies the drafts in parallel. However, SD suffers from the mutual waiting problem, i.e., the target model gets stuck when the draft model is *guessing* tokens, and vice versa (the dashed dialogue box). PEARL parallels the drafting and verification process to alleviate the mutual waiting problem. Moreover, PEARL can leverage adaptive draft length to generate more tokens within the same amount of time to further mitigate the mutual waiting problem. Specifically, PEARL generates fewer draft tokens if they will be rejected (step 1 in the lower part), and more draft tokens if they can be accepted (steps 3 and 4).](imgs/intro_fig_0926.pdf){#overview width=\"0.9\\\\columnwidth\"}\n\nTo address this challenge, extensive research efforts have been devoted to accelerating LLM inference. Given that inference from large models is often constrained more by memory bandwidth and communication than by arithmetic operations [@leviathan2023fast], one innovative inference paradigm, Speculative Decoding (SD), has emerged as a new trend and shown superior performance by effectively enabling better GPU utilization. As shown in the upper part of Figure. [1](#overview){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"overview\"}, the key idea of the SD algorithm is to employ an extra small model (referred as the *draft model*) to first generate $\\gamma$ draft tokens for the original large model (referred as the *target model*), and then the target model verifies these draft tokens in parallel within a single forward. Here, $\\gamma$ is a fixed hyperparameter **window size**. **Draft length** is the number of tokens generated by the draft model in a continuous execution. Therefore, the draft length is set to $\\gamma$ in SD. Following-up works effectively extend this framework by either removing the necessity of the draft model [@cai2024medusa; @fu2024break; @zhang2023draft] or identifying a compact draft model with high distribution alignment [@zhou2023distillspec; @zhao2024ouroboros; @miao2023specinfer]. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this *draft-then-verify* framework effectively enhances the concurrency of the target model, thereby significantly accelerating the inference process.\n\nAlbeit with multiple benefits of this *draft-then-verify* framework, it confronts one significant challenge that may hinder its performance and deployment---the mutual waiting problem. That is, the target model will be idle when the draft model is generating the draft tokens and the draft model will be idle when the target model is verifying the previously drafted tokens. This mutual waiting problem primarily stems from two limitations inherent in speculative decoding: **(i)** the asynchronous execution of the draft and verify phases, which directly results in the mutual waiting problem; and **(ii)** the fixed draft length, which cannot adapt to most decoding steps and thus exacerbate the mutual waiting problem.\n\nTherefore, in this paper, we seek to answer the question: *Can we draft and verify in parallel and adaptively adjust draft length?* With this consideration, we propose a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework to boost speculative decoding, namely **P**arallel sp**E**culative decoding with **A**daptive d**R**aft **L**ength (PEARL). Specifically, PEARL consists of two strategies *pre-verify* and *post-verify*: **(i)** *pre-verify* uses the target model to verify the first draft token during drafting phase, which allows the draft model to generate less draft tokens in difficult scenarios; **(ii)** *post-verify* uses the draft model to continue generating draft tokens during verification phase, which provides more draft tokens in simple situations. As shown in the lower part of Figure.[1](#overview){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"overview\"}, PEARL effectively alleviates the mutual waiting problem with **parallelism** and **adaptive draft length** via these two strategies. We conduct extensive experiments on various text generation benchmarks, leading to a superior speed up performance up to **4.43$\\times$** and **1.50$\\times$**, compared to auto-regressive decoding and speculative decoding, respectively."},{"heading":"Background","text":"# Background\n\n<figure id=\"motivation_exp\">\n\n<figcaption>Motivated observations. (a) The time of both the drafting phase and verification phase is non-negligible, therefore the asynchronous execution of the draft model and the target model directly incurs the mutual waiting problem. (b) We observe that the optimal draft length changes significantly in different iterations, which exacerbates the mutual waiting problem.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n**Notations.** In this paper, we use $M_q$ to denote the draft model and $M_p$ to denote the target model. $M_q(\\cdot),M_p(\\cdot)$ denotes the logits of the next token of a single forward of $M_q, M_p$ respectively. $\\gamma$ is a hyperparameter to control the window size during speculative decoding. We denote the running speed between $M_q$ and $M_p$ as $c$, which is defined as the ratio between the time for a single forward of $M_p$ and the time for a single forward of $M_q$, i.e., $c=T(M_p(\\cdot)) / T(M_q(\\cdot))$.\n\n**Speculative decoding.** Given an input sequence $\\mathbf{x}$ as a prefix, a speculative decoding step consists of a drafting phase and a verification phase. During the drafting phase, the draft model $M_q$ is employed to give $\\gamma$ draft tokens $x_1, x_2,...,x_\\gamma$ by running $\\gamma$ times model forward and sample. Here, we denote $M_q(\\mathbf{x}+[x_1,...,x_{i-1}])$ as $q_i$, then each draft token is given by $x_i \\sim q_{i}, i=1,...,\\gamma$. During the verification phase, the prefix $\\mathbf{x}$ together with $\\gamma$ draft tokens are sent to $M_p$ for verification. The target model $M_p$ inputs $\\mathbf{x}+[x_1, ..., x_\\gamma]$ and outputs the logits $p_1, p_2, ..., p_{\\gamma+1}$. Then SD sequentially verifies $x_i$ via speculative sampling, where the acceptance rate is given by:\n\n$$\\alpha_i=\\left\\{\n    \\begin{aligned}\n        &1 \\qquad\\quad p_i[x_i] \\geq q_i[x_i], \\\\\n        &\\frac{p_i[x_i]}{q_i[x_i]} \\quad p_i[x_i] < q_i[x_i],\\\\\n    \\end{aligned}\n    \\right.$$\n\nIf SD rejects $x_i$, it will resample a token from $norm(\\max(0, p_i - q_i))$, otherwise, SD accepts all the draft tokens and samples an additional token from $p_{\\gamma+1}$. In this way, each SD step generates tokens with a number of at least 1 and at most $\\gamma+1$, leading to efficiency acceleration.\n\n**Window size and draft length.** We emphasize that the window size is a hyperparameter that controls the drafting behavior. Draft length is the number of tokens generated by the draft model in a continuous execution, which is fixed and the same as the window size in SD, while draft length is adaptive and may be not equal to window size in PEARL."},{"heading":"Methodology","text":"# Methodology\n\n## Motivated Observation\n\nAs illustrated in Figure. [2](#motivation_exp){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"motivation_exp\"}(a), the mutual waiting problem is directly incurred by the asynchronous execution of the draft model and the target model. In our experiments, we observe that the time consumed during the drafting phase and the verification phase is usually non-negligible. Take the instance of Codellama 7B & 34B, at each decoding step, although the running speed of Codellama 7B is almost 3 times faster than Codellama 34B, the total time consumption for generating 6 draft tokens is even 2 times than the time consumption for one verification step. Therefore, the mutual waiting problem exists **at any timestamp**, and severely affects the acceleration effectiveness of SD.\n\nThe asynchronous execution of the draft model and the target model is the direct cause of the mutual waiting problem, which is determined by two requirements of speculative decoding: (1) the drafting phase requires the input prefix to be verified; (2) the verification phase requires the draft model to complete generating draft tokens. This implies the great potential for alleviating the mutual waiting problem through parallelism: if we can remove the two requirements and parallel the drafting phase and the verification phase, a substantial acceleration can be possible.\n\nAnother limitation that aggravates the mutual waiting problem is the fixed draft length in SD, which is not appropriate for all the decoding steps. As shown in Figure [2](#motivation_exp){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"motivation_exp\"}(b), the optimal draft length changes significantly in different iterations. On the one hand, when the optimal draft length is less than the fixed draft length, the draft model will generate meaningless draft tokens that block the target model. On another hand, when the optimal draft length is more than the fixed draft length, the draft model could have generated more draft tokens that can be accepted by the target model with a single forward. However, a fixed draft length will interrupt the longer drafting phase and take an additional verification phase, which strengthens the mutual waiting problem as well. This motivates our PEARL to further alleviate the mutual waiting problem with adaptive draft length.\n\nTogether with the two motivations, we propose two simple and effective strategies, *pre-verify* and *post-verify*. The *pre-verify* removes requirement 2 and allows the target model to verify the first draft token in advance. The *post-verify* removes requirement 1 and allows the draft model to continue generating draft tokens during the verification phase. The two strategies enable parallelism and achieve adaptive draft length to effectively alleviate the mutual waiting problem.\n\n![Illustration of our PEARL. At $T=0$, $M_q$ generates $x_1, x_2, x_3$ and $M_p$ rejects $x_1$ with the *pre-verify* strategy. At $T=3t$, $M_p$ accepts $x_4$ and switches to the *post-verify* strategy. At $T=6t$, $M_p$ accepts all draft tokens $x_4, x_5, x_6$ in the last decoding step, while $M_q$ continues drafting $x_7, x_8, x_9$. At $T=9t$, $M_p$ rejects $x_9$, drops $x_{10}, x_{11}, x_{12}$ and switches to the *pre-verify* strategy. The final output is $[y_1, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8, y_2]$.](imgs/PEARL.pdf){#PEARL width=\"100%\"}\n\n## Pre-verify: verify the first draft token in advance.\n\nThe *pre-verify* strategy aims at removing the requirement that the verification phase requires the draft model to complete generating draft tokens. Therefore, we seek to verify some draft tokens in advance during the drafting phase. We delve explicitly into the drafting stage. During the drafting phase, the draft model tries to give $\\gamma$ draft tokens by running $\\gamma$ times model forward. We find that the input of the draft model in $\\gamma$ times forward is $\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{x} + [x_1]$, \\..., $\\mathbf{x} + [x_1, x_2, ..., x_{\\gamma-1}]$, respectively. Only the origin prefix $\\mathbf{x}$ can be acquired by the target model for parallel verification. Therefore, we propose to run the target model to output the logits $M_p(\\mathbf{x})$ in parallel. In this way, we can verify the first token $x_1$ before the verification phase. We implement the same lossless verification method following [@leviathan2023fast] as illustrated in Section [2](#background){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"background\"}.\n\nBy applying such a *pre-verify* strategy, we can verify the first draft token before the verification phase. If the first token is rejected, all of the following draft tokens are meaningless and should be dropped. Hence we could skip the verification phase and directly conduct the next drafting phase with the prefix $\\mathbf{x} + [y_1]$. If the first token is accepted, all the draft tokens will be sent to the target model in the verification phase. In Figure. [3](#PEARL){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"PEARL\"}, at the timestamp of $T=0$, the draft model generates $x_1, x_2, x_3$ while the target model outputs $p_0^t$, rejects the first token $x_1$ and sample another token $y_1$. At the timestamp of $T=3t$, the draft model generates $x_4, x_5, x_6$ while the target model accepts the first token $x_4$. Then $x_4, x_5, x_6$ is sent to the target model in the next verification phase.\n\n## Post-verify: continue drafting during verification.\n\nThe *post-verify* strategy aims at removing the requirement that the drafting phase requires the input prefix to be verified. However, this assumption brings the limitation that the draft model should be stuck until the target model finishes verification.\n\nTherefore, we discard this assumption and make another assumption: we directly assume that all the draft tokens can be accepted. In this way, We find that when all the $\\gamma$ draft tokens are accepted, sampling a new token from $M_p(\\mathbf{x}+[x_1, ..., x_{\\gamma}])$ is not necessary, as the draft model could have generated more draft tokens that can be accepted. Hence we can use the draft model to continue drafting $x_{\\gamma+1}, ..., x_{2\\gamma}$ during the verification phase.\n\n:::: algorithm\n::: algorithmic\n\\\nInitialization: mode $\\leftarrow$ \\\"pre-verify\\\" $\\mathbf{x}$, mode $\\leftarrow$ Pre-verify($M_q, M_p, \\mathbf{x}, \\gamma$) $\\mathbf{x}$, mode $\\leftarrow$ Post-verify($M_q, M_p, \\mathbf{x}, \\gamma$)\n:::\n::::\n\nIf all the $\\gamma$ draft tokens are accepted, we can skip the next drafting phase as we already get the draft tokens in the next drafting phase. The last logit $M_p(\\mathbf{x}+[x_1, ..., x_{\\gamma}])$ can be used to verify $x_{\\gamma+1}$, which is a *\\\"pre-verify\\\"* process as well. In Figure. [3](#PEARL){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"PEARL\"}, at the timestamp of $T=6t$, the target model takes in $x_4, x_5, x_6$ and outputs $p^t_{x_4}, p^t_{x_5}, p^t_{x_6}$, while the draft model continues to guess next draft tokens $x_7, x_8, x_9$. Fortunately, all the draft tokens are accepted, and we can directly conduct the next verification phase with prefix $\\mathbf{x}+[y_1, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8, x_9]$. At the timestamp of $T=9t$, the target model takes in $x_7, x_8, x_9$ and outputs $p^t_{x_7}, p^t_{x_8}, p^t_{x_9}$, while the draft model continues to guess the next draft tokens $x_{10}, x_{11}, x_{12}$. Unfortunately, only $x_8$ is accepted, and the draft tokens $x_{10}, x_{11}, x_{12}$ will be dropped. Finally, the prefix $\\mathbf{x} + [y_1, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8, y_2]$ is input to the next drafting phase.\n\n## PEARL: parallel speculative decoding with adaptive draft length {#method_adaptive_draft_length}\n\nTaking together the two strategies, our PEARL framework consists of a draft model, a target model, and two strategies to decode tokens. The two strategies are switched according to the verification results in the previous decoding step. Algorithm [\\[alg_method\\]](#alg_method){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"alg_method\"} provides a summary of our PEARL. We also provide more details in Algorithm [\\[alg_party\\]](#alg_party){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"alg_party\"}. Note that pre-verify and post-verify strategies are not executed only once in the process of generating a sentence and will be repeatedly switched according to the token acceptance situation during the whole process of generating. We provide a simple step-by-step profiling example in Appendix [8](#profiling){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"profiling\"} for better understanding. Then we show how our PEARL achieves parallelism and adaptive draft length to alleviate the mutual waiting problem.\n\n**Parallelism.** With the two strategies *pre-verify* and *post-verify*, At any timestamp, the draft model and the target model are running in parallel, which directly breaks the asynchronous execution of the draft model and the target model.\n\n**Adaptive draft length.** In our PEARL, the drafting process can be seen as a segmented drafting process. If the draft model cannot generate any \\\"right\\\" tokens, the *pre-verify* strategy will avoid the additional drafting process. If the draft model could have generated more \\\"right\\\" tokens, the target model would not interrupt the drafting phase, where the draft model can generate more draft tokens with *post-verify* strategy. Therefore, PEARL can utilize the two simple yet effective strategies to implement adaptive draft length to alleviate the mutual waiting problem."},{"heading":"Experiments","text":"# Experiments\n\n## Experimental Setup {#exp_setup}\n\n**Tasks and Datasets.** We conduct experiments on various text generation tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of our PEARL, including HumanEval (code generation task) [@chen2021evaluating], GSM8K & MGSM (multilingual arithmetic reasoning task, MGSM is the multilingual translation of GSM8K) [@cobbe2021training; @shi2210language], and MT-bench (multi-round dialogue task) [@zheng2024judging]. These tasks and datasets are representative benchmarks for evaluation. More details can be found in Appendix [9.1](#dataset_config){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"dataset_config\"}.\n\n**Evaluation Details.** We evaluate the effectiveness of our PEARL with some state-of-the-art LLM families, including CodeLlama [@roziere2023code], Deepseek-Coder [@guo2024deepseek], Llama 2 [@touvron2023llama] and Llama 3.1 [@dubey2024llama]. In our experiments, the models with size less than 7B are used as the draft models and the models with size greater than 33B are used as the target models. We report the walltime speedup ratio as the metric.

As shown in Table [\\[main_res_tab\\]](#main_res_tab){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"main_res_tab\"}, PEARL significantly outperforms vanilla speculative decoding, Ouroboros, Lookahead decoding and assisted generation in all backbone model configurations on the HumanEval dataset, which encompass different scales of model configurations including $1.3$&$33$B, $6.7$&$33$B ($7$&$34$B) and $7$&$70$B. Specifically, PEARL can achieve up to $4.43$$\\times$ and $1.50$$\\times$ speed up compared with vanilla auto-regressive methods and vanilla speculative decoding, respectively. These results indicate the universal existence of the mutual waiting problem, and demonstrate that PEARL effectively addresses the mutual waiting problem, thereby achieving significant inference acceleration results compared to methods based on the traditional draft-then-verify framework. Moreover, as shown in Table [\\[main_res_tab_2\\]](#main_res_tab_2){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"main_res_tab_2\"}, [\\[main_res_tab_3\\]](#main_res_tab_3){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"main_res_tab_3\"}, PEARL can also achieve significant inference acceleration on 12 multilingual arithmetic tasks and 8 multi-round dialogue tasks, whereas PEARL can achieve $1.36\\sim 1.55\\times$ speedup compared with vanilla speculative decoding. These results demonstrate the superior potential of the parallel speculative decoding framework to exploit the computation resources more adequately. We provide more evaluation results on MGSM and MT-bench with more advanced Llama $3.1$ $8$&$70$B in Appendix [10](#more_exp_results){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"more_exp_results\"}.\n\n## Ablation studies\n\nTo provide more insights into the two proposed strategies, we conduct the ablation study. We denote PEARL without *pre-verify* as PEARL*w/o pre-verify* and PEARL without *post-verify* as PEARL*w/o post-verify* and present the main results of ablation studies.\n\nAs shown in Table [\\[tab:ablation\\]](#tab:ablation){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"tab:ablation\"}, the absence of any strategy of PEARL results in a performance degradation of the entire framework. The absence of the *post-verify* strategy exhibits a more pronounced impact on the performance of PEARL than the *pre-verify* strategy. We explain the reason for this phenomenon as follows. Intuitively, the *pre-verify* strategy makes more contributions when the acceptance rate is relatively low. The *pre-verify* strategy can save a target model forward when the first draft token is rejected by the target model. Denote the acceptance rate as $\\alpha$, and the *pre-verify* strategy will take effect with probability $1-\\alpha$. Therefore, better alignment between the draft model and the target model will make *pre-verify* strategy less effective. However, the *post-verify* strategy makes more contributions when the two models are aligned, i.e., there are more situations in which all draft tokens are accepted by the target model. Therefore, the two strategies are complementary and accelerate inference together.\n\nIn our experiments, all the model combinations show great alignment, which leads to the superiority of the *post-verify* strategy. As the language models evolve and more speculative decoding methods, the alignment between the draft model and the target model will be better, which further highlights the importance of the *post-verify* strategy. Meanwhile, we can further improve the *pre-verify* strategy by pre-verifying multiple draft tokens (similar to the cache pool in Ouroboros and Lookahead Decoding) for more acceleration. We leave these as future works.\n\n## Case studies\n\nIn this subsection, we present two important case studies to discuss the sensitive analysis of $\\gamma$ and the mean accepted tokens of PEARL. We provide more experiment results in Appendix [10](#more_exp_results){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"more_exp_results\"}.\n\n### Sensitive Analysis of the window size $\\gamma$ {#gamma_case}\n\nIntuitively, the optimal value of the window size $\\gamma$ should be the speed ratio $c$ between the draft model and the target model, where the draft model and the target model can achieve best parallelism and fully alleviate the mutual waiting problem. However, it is often the case that $c$ may not be an integer. Therefore, we propose to select the round integer of $c$ as the window size $\\gamma$. We conduct some case studies to see the effect of different $\\gamma$ values in different model configurations and different tasks. As shown in Table [\\[tab:gamma_res_case\\]](#tab:gamma_res_case){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"tab:gamma_res_case\"} (we mark the round integer below each model configuration), directly choosing the round integer of $c$ as the window size can achieve the maximal inference acceleration, which is robust to the model configurations. Meanwhile, as shown in Table [\\[tab:mean_acc_token\\]](#tab:mean_acc_token){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"tab:mean_acc_token\"} (the round integer of $c$ of Llama 2 7&70B is 5), setting the window size as 5 can achieve the maximal inference acceleration as well, which is robust to the tasks. These results suggest great convenience of PEARL framework which alleviates the burden of tuning $\\gamma$ for different model configurations and different tasks.\n\n::: minipage\n:::\n\n::: minipage\n:::\n\n### Mean accepted tokens {#token_case}\n\nIn Section [3.4](#method_adaptive_draft_length){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"method_adaptive_draft_length\"}, we claim that PEARL can achieve adaptive draft length for acceleration. To further illustrate the real mean accepted tokens in PEARL under real-world complex conditions, we conduct experiments on the HumanEval, GSM8K, and MT-Bench datasets. As shown in Table [\\[tab:aat\\]](#tab:aat){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"tab:aat\"}, we still empirically observe that that PEARL obtains more accepted tokens compared to vanilla SD methods, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of the PEARL framework. Specifically, PEARL achieves the max number of mean accepted tokens to **39.9**, which significantly outperforms vanilla SD methods by a large margin. Note that the mean accepted tokens (**MAT**) and the speed ratio c between the draft model and the target model both influence the final speed-up results. For example, in the case of Deepseek 6.7&33B, the draft model runs approximately three times faster than the target model. Even if the MAT approaches infinity, where all tokens are generated by the 6.7B model, the theoretical maximum speed-up would be capped at 3$\\times$. Consequently, with a MAT of 39.9, PEARL achieves a 2.75$\\times$ speed-up, which is close to this theoretical optimum. These results demonstrate that our PEARL can fully exploit the inference ability of the draft model for further acceleration.\n\n## More Discussions on PEARL\n\n#### Clarification of the application scenarios.\n\nFirst, we would like to clarify the application scenarios of our PEARL. The key idea of speculative decoding is to exploit the computation redundancy for acceleration [@leviathan2023fast]. Based on this idea, we observe the mutual waiting problem, which hinders speculative decoding to fully utilize the redundant computational resources. Therefore, the main application scenarios of PEARL focus on the scenarios with adequate computational resources, where speculative decoding cannot sufficiently use these resources.\n\n#### PEARL in resource-adequate scenarios.\n\nIn such scenarios, the draft model and the target model can be deployed separately. Simultaneously running the draft model and the target model would not bring additional latency in either both drafting or verification stages. Our main experiments along with all baseline methods are conducted under these scenarios, where we deploy the draft model and the target model on different devices. Besides, it is feasible to integrate tensor parallelism (TP) with PEARL in these situations. We provide the solution in Appendix [12](#pearl_tp){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"pearl_tp\"}.\n\n#### PEARL in resource-constrained scenarios.\n\nHowever, we acknowledge that in many situations, the GPU resources are limited, and the draft model and the target model are deployed on the same devices. We refer to this as a \"co-locate\" setting or resource competitions (RC). The key problem lies in the nature of GPU hardware design---two running processes on the same GPU will compete for GPU resources, which may lead to slowdowns. We provide a solution to address this issue.\n\nGenerally, in real-world LLM applications, the large-scale target model is usually placed with more than 1 GPU to handle more requests and long context inference, while the small-scale draft model only needs 1 GPU for inference. In this case, we can apply pipeline parallelism (PP) to serve the target model with multiple GPUs. Inspired by this observation, we propose an improved version of PEARL to effectively utilize GPU computation resources with PP without resource competitions. The key idea is to transfer the computation of the draft model to another GPU when the target model is running on a specific GPU. Specifically, we transfer the first $\\lceil \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\rceil$ draft token generation to the last device, while the last $\\lfloor \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\rfloor$ draft tokens are generated with the first device. As the computation of the target model is conducted sequentially with multiple GPUs, this could effectively utilize the GPU resources to avoid RC. We conduct some experiments in Table [\\[app:rc\\]](#app:rc){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"app:rc\"} and find that this strategy allows PEARL to retain $89\\% \\sim 99\\%$ of its original performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our PEARL in such conditions. We provide detailed implementation and additional experiment results of this strategy in Appendix [13](#app_rc_section){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"app_rc_section\"}."},{"heading":"Related Work","text":"# Related Work\n\n**Transformer inference acceleration.** Inference acceleration is a field that has been extensively studied over a long period of time [@rest]. There exists extensive works for transformer inference acceleration with the rising of LLMs [@unlocking; @coft_2024; @sac-kg]. This includes efforts of model compression [@zhu2023survey], efficient architecture design [@chitty2022neural], and hardware optimization and implementation [@dao2022flashattention]. Model compression methods such as quantization [@choi2018pact], knowledge distillation [@hinton2015distilling], and structure pruning [@han2015deep] aim at reducing the number of computational operations. Efficient architecture design is proposed to develop lightweight transformer architectures. Hardware optimization and implementation is proposed for efficient execution to fully exploit the hardware devices. These methods have achieved great success, while they are orthogonal to speculative decoding algorithms, which can be integrated for further speedup.\n\n**Draft-then-verify framework.** While SD exhibits great acceleration effectiveness and lossless generalization quality, it remains a challenge to find a compact draft model with high distribution alignment. Some works focus on removing the necessity of the draft model. Self-speculative decoding [@zhang2023draft] proposes to skip some intermediate layers of the target model for drafting. Medusa [@cai2024medusa] adds extra decoding heads at the top of the target model to generate drafts. Lookahead decoding[@fu2024break] caches the generation trajectory (n-grams) as the drafts. Eagle [@li2024eagle] employs an additional transformer decoder layer to generate drafts at the feature level. Glide [@du2024glide] reuses the kv cache from the target model to decode more accurate draft tokens. DistillSpec [@zhou2023distillspec] utilizes distillation method to identify a compact draft model. Ouroboros [@zhao2024ouroboros] combines the standard SD and lookahead decoding to generate more precise and longer drafts. Besides these works, SpecInfer [@miao2023specinfer] proposes tree attention, which is widely used to verify more drafts and increase the acceptance rate. However, all of them do not address the parallelism issue. From this perspective, our PEARL is orthogonal to these methods and can be integrated with these methods, which is left as a future work."},{"heading":"Conclusion and Future Work","text":"# Conclusion and Future Work {#conclusion}\n\n**Limitations and broader impact.** As our PEARL is a parallel acceleration framework, it remains a challenge to schedule the GPU resources to avoid resource competitions, which may potentially increase power consumption. We affirm our commitment to contributing positively to society, avoiding harm, and upholding honesty and trustworthiness. We appropriately cite the previous methods and datasets we use, and ensure that all data involved is fully public, with no private data being utilized. Furthermore, we are committed to correctly maintaining the inference acceleration techniques we have developed, without incurring any form of discrimination.\n\n**Conclusion.** In this paper, we propose a novel inference acceleration framework, called PEARL, which significantly improves LLM inference efficiency. PEARL consists of two simple and effective strategies, i.e., *pre-verify* and *post-verify*, which effectively alleviates the mutual waiting problem with parallelism and adaptive draft length. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PEARL outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various text generation benchmarks.\n\n**Future work.** For future research, we aim to integrate PEARL with existing accelerated inference methods to explore more efficient and resource-friendly acceleration approaches for LLM inference.

The key to integrating TP is to deploy the draft model and the target model on separate devices. The most direct way is to deploy the small-scale draft model on 1 GPU and the large-scale target model on the rest GPUs. Take the example of 8 GPUs, we can place the draft model on GPU 0, while the target model is set on GPUs 1-7. In this way, the draft model and the target model can conduct parallel inference and achieve the best inference speedup. Meanwhile, it is possible to deploy the draft model on CPU / edge computing. The separation idea is similar to PD dis-aggregation [@zhong2024distserve], which dis-aggregates the prefilling and decoding process on different devices to fully exploit the computation resources. **PEARL shares the same idea to disaggregate the decoding process of the draft model and the target model on different devices.**\n\nHowever, we notice that in the modern TP framework, layer width should be divisible by TP size (which would not work with TP=7 as shown in the example. We propose to use padding techniques to address the division issue directly. For example, given a weight matrix $W \\in \\mathcal{R}^{4096 \\times 4096}$ and TP=7, we can append an extra zero matrix $W_{pad} \\in \\mathcal{R}^{4096 \\times 6}$ to $W$, and form a padded weight matrix $\\hat{W} \\in \\mathcal{R}^{4096 \\times 4102}$. In this way, the dimension issue can be effectively addressed. For other $W$ and TP size pairs, we can get the padded matrix similarly. We provide some explanation to show this padding technique is lossless to the performance.\n\n1.  For MLP layers, padding a zero matrix $W_{pad} \\in \\mathcal{R}^{d \\times r}$ to the weight matrix does not affect the final results. Directly remove the final $r$ columns of the output can get the original output.\n\n2.  For attention layers, padding a zero matrix $W_{pad} \\in \\mathcal{R}^{d \\times r}$ to the weight matrix is equivalent to padding a zero matrix to $Q, K$, where $Q_{pad} = Q[W^Q;W_{pad}^Q], K_{pad} = K[W^K;W_{pad}^K]$. The attention weight is computed as $Q_{pad}K_{pad}^T=Q[W^Q;W_{pad}^Q][W^K;W_{pad}^K]^TK^T$. As $W_{pad}^Q$ and $W_{pad}^K$ are zero matrices, $[W^Q;W_{pad}^Q][W^K;W_{pad}^K]^T=W^Q(W^K)^T$, i.e., $Q_{pad}K_{pad}^T=QK^T$. Therefore, padding does not affect the attention weight matrix.\n\n3.  For norm layers, padding a zero matrix may change the scaling factor, e.g., variance in RMSNorm. When computing these scaling factors, ignoring the additional zeros can keep the original results.\n\nDue to the complexity of implementing TP with an existing framework (vLLM [@kwon2023efficient]), we leave this as a promising future work to integrate TP with PEARL."},{"heading":"Experiment Results under Limited GPU Resources","text":"# Experiment Results under Limited GPU Resources {#app_rc_section}\n\nAlthough our PEARL parallels the draft model and the target model at the algorithmic level, it still remains a challenge for deployment at the hardware level in the GPU-constrained scenarios, which we refer to as \\\"co-locate\\\" setting or resource competitions (RC). The key problem lies in the nature of GPU hardware design ---- two running processes on the same GPU will compete for GPU resources, which leads to significant slowdowns.\n\nHowever, in real-world LLM applications, the large-scale target model is usually placed with more than 1 GPU to handle more requests and long context inference, while the small-scale draft model only needs 1 GPU for inference. In this case, pipeline parallelism (PP) is the most common solution to serve the target model with multiple GPUs, which distributes the parameters to different GPUs and conducts computations sequentially with these GPUs.\n\nInspired by this observation, we propose an improved version of PEARL to effectively utilize GPU computation resources with PP without resource competitions. The key idea is to transfer the computation of the draft model to another GPU when the target model is running on a specific GPU. Specifically, we transfer the first $\\lceil \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\rceil$ draft token generation to the last device, while the last $\\lfloor \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\rfloor$ draft tokens are generated with the first device. As the computation of the target model is conducted sequentially with multiple GPUs, this method could effectively utilize the GPU resources to avoid resource competition.\n\nTake an instance of $c=5$, the target model is placed with $g=4$ GPUs, we denote the time for a target model forward as $t$, and the time that the target model runs at GPU 0 is $\\frac{t}{4}$. To analyze the GPU utilization in detail, we split $t$ into $gc=20$ steps, where each step $\\eta=\\frac{t}{20}$. During one target model forward, the occupied GPU number in 20 steps is given by:\n\n$$M_p: \\quad \\colorbox{green!30}{0, 0, 0, 0, 0;} \\colorbox{blue!30}{1, 1, 1, 1, 1;} \\colorbox{red!30}{2, 2, 2, 2, 2;} \\colorbox{yellow!30}{3, 3, 3, 3, 3;}$$\n\nThen we can further analyze the occupied GPU number of the draft model with proposed methods. First, as the draft model can generate $c$ tokens in 20 steps, it only needs 4 steps to generate 1 draft token. Taking $\\lceil \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\rceil = 3, \\lfloor \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\rfloor = 2$, the first $3\\times 4=12$ steps of the draft model will occupy the GPU 3, while the last $2\\times 4=8$ steps of the draft model will occupy the GPU 0. Therefore, the occupied GPU number of the draft model in 20 steps is given by:\n\n$$M_q: \\quad \\colorbox{yellow!30}{3, 3, 3, 3;}\\colorbox{yellow!30}{3, 3, 3, 3;}\\colorbox{yellow!30}{3, 3, 3, 3;}\\colorbox{green!30}{0, 0, 0, 0;}\\colorbox{green!30}{0, 0, 0, 0;}$$\n\nIn this way, the draft model and the target model will occupy different devices at each step, which effectively avoids resource competition. However, in real-world settings, moving the draft model from the last device to the first device is non-trivial and costly. As a compromise, We propose to load the draft model both at the first device and the last device. During the inference process, we only move the intermediate KV Cache from the last device to the first device. Many KV Cache compression methods can help further reduce the cost. As the draft model is relatively small, the KV cache itself does not incur significant memory overhead. For example, with Llama 3.1 8B, batch size=1 and input length=1024, the size of the KV cache is $2\\times2\\times32\\times1\\times8\\times1024\\times128\\approx 0.13 \\text{GB}$. With NVlink, the theoretical time cost for transporting the KV cache is $0.13/300\\approx0.43 \\text{ms}$, which is significantly lower than the computational time cost.

The mutual waiting problem, which arises when the target model becomes idle while waiting for the draft model to generate tokens, and vice versa. The asynchronous execution of the draft and verification phases leads to inefficiencies. 2. Fixed draft model length.\n\nThe authors introduced two strategies to solve this issue: 1. Pre-verification: This strategy involves using the target model to verify the first draft token during the drafting phase. By doing this, PEARL can determine whether the drafted token will likely be accepted or rejected.\nIf the first draft token is verified and accepted, the draft model can generate additional tokens more confidently. Conversely, if the first token is likely rejected, the draft model can generate fewer tokens, thus saving computational resources and time. \n\n2. Post-verification: In this phase, the draft model generates additional draft tokens while the target model verifies the previously drafted tokens. This allows for a more continuous flow of token generation and verification. By enabling the draft model to produce more tokens during the verification phase, PEARL capitalizes on situations where the target model is actively processing the earlier drafts. This strategy ensures that the draft model is not idle while waiting for the target model to complete its verification, thus maximizing throughput.\n\nStrengths: The paper is clearly written and provides several contributions: \n\n1. PEARL allows the drafting and verification phases to occur simultaneously\n\n2. Instead of using a fixed draft length, PEARL adapts the number of draft tokens generated based on the context and complexity of the task. This flexibility ensures that the draft model generates an appropriate number of tokens, reducing unnecessary computations and improving the acceptance rate of tokens by the target model. This adaptability helps to optimize the inference process for different scenarios.\n\n3. PEARL theoretically demonstrates that it can achieve a higher mean number of accepted tokens compared to existing draft-then-verify methods. This means that more of the generated tokens are useful, leading to better performance overall\n\nWeaknesses: The author claims that they can continue doing draft generation while doing the verification. This raises many questions:\n\n1. The latency of verifying a 70B model is about generating 2.5 tokens on the 8B model. Based on the speedup that the authors provided, this parallel approach would not work beyond a lookahead length of 3, which is shown to be suboptimal empirically. Therefore it is not clear how much this post-verify step improves the performance. \n\n2. Some parameters are underspecified in the tokens accepted per second table (Table). It is not clear under what lookahead length are the baseline numbers achieved, or if they are optimal.\n\n3. The authors picked pipeline parallelism for their implementation. However, while this is a convenient setup for solving the \"resource contention\" challenge, this is an unreasonable setting and introduces much higher latency in the first place. In deploying a 70B target model with a 7B draft model, using tensor parallelism (TP) can reduce the latency of the target model by leveraging more parallelism in each layer. Therefore, this casts doubt on all the speedup that the authors reported as this causes both the baseline and their reported results to be slower than in a TP setup. Also, with TP, the proposed solution to resource contention in Appendix E would not apply and it is not clear whether the authors can show a similar speedup with their algorithm.\n\n4. Furthermore, using PP instead of TP causes a higher activation memory footprint, reducing the effective batchsize the model can accommodate during decoding, effectively reducing the overall throughput.\n\nQuestions: My concerns are raised above.","rationale_pred":"Paper Summary: The paper introduces PEARL, a novel framework for speculative decoding that addresses the mutual waiting problem in large language model inference by employing adaptive draft lengths and parallel verification strategies.

Previous efforts on voice conversion focus on factorizing speech into explicitly disentangled representations that separately encode speaker characteristics and linguistic content. However, disentangling speech representations to capture such attributes using task-specific loss terms can lead to information loss by discarding finer nuances such as accent and emotion of the original signal. In this work, instead of explicitly disentangling attributes with loss terms, we present a framework to train a controllable voice conversion model on entangled speech representations derived from self-supervised learning (SSL) and speaker verification models. First, we develop techniques to derive prosodic information from the audio signal and SSL representations to train predictive submodules in the synthesis model. Next, we propose a training strategy to iteratively improve the synthesis model for voice conversion, by creating a challenging training objective using self-synthesized examples. In this training approach, the current state of the synthesis model is used to generate voice-converted variations of an utterance, which serve as inputs for the reconstruction task, ensuring a continuous and purposeful refinement of the model. We demonstrate that incorporating such self-synthesized examples during training improves the speaker similarity of generated speech as compared to a baseline voice conversion model trained solely on heuristically perturbed inputs. Our framework is trained without any text and is applicable to a range of tasks such as zero-shot voice conversion, voice conversion across different languages, and controllable speech synthesis with pitch and pace modifications.

The conventional joint density Gaussian mixture model (JDGMM) based spectral conversion methods perform stably and effectively. However, the speech generated by these methods suffer severe quality degradation due to the following two factors: 1) inadequacy of JDGMM in modeling the distribution of spectral features as well as the non-linear mapping relationship between the source and target speakers, 2) spectral detail loss caused by the use of high-level spectral features such as mel-cepstra. Previously, we have proposed to use the mixture of restricted Boltzmann machines (MoRBM) and the mixture of Gaussian bidirectional associative memories (MoGBAM) to cope with these problems. In this paper, we propose to use a DNN to construct a global non-linear mapping relationship between the spectral envelopes of two speakers. The proposed DNN is generatively trained by cascading two RBMs, which model the distributions of spectral envelopes of source and target speakers respectively, using a Bernoulli BAM (BBAM). Therefore, the proposed training method takes the advantage of the strong modeling ability of RBMs in modeling the distribution of spectral envelopes and the superiority of BAMs in deriving the conditional distributions for conversion. Careful comparisons and analysis among the proposed method and some conventional methods are presented in this paper. The subjective results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance in terms of both similarity and naturalness compared to conventional methods.","score":0.6460428833961487,"polarity":"positive","source":"citations","year":2014,"authors":["Linghui Chen","Zhenhua Ling","Li-Juan Liu","Lirong Dai"],"venue":null,"citation_count":228,"reference_count":47,"influential_citation_count":8,"corpus_id":11313515,"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5cb6307f25a8af6e8081405db88dc9c837cf5b27","arxiv_id":null,"contexts":[{"sentence":"Traditionally, voice conversion models were trained as a speech-to-speech translation system on a parallel dataset containing multiple speakers saying the same utterance~\\citep{sun2015dblstm, chen2014dnn}.","polarity":"positive"}],"background":null,"target":null},{"summary":"The Related Paper supports the Main Paper by addressing the limitations of traditional voice conversion methods that rely on parallel data and explicit disentanglement of speaker and content representations.

Previous efforts on voice conversion focus on factorizing speech into explicitly disentangled representations that separately encode speaker characteristics and linguistic content. However, disentangling speech representations to capture such attributes using task-specific loss terms can lead to information loss by discarding finer nuances such as accent and emotion of the original signal. In this work, instead of explicitly disentangling attributes with loss terms, we present a framework to train a controllable voice conversion model on entangled speech representations derived from self-supervised learning (SSL) and speaker verification models. First, we develop techniques to derive prosodic information from the audio signal and SSL representations to train predictive submodules in the synthesis model. Next, we propose a training strategy to iteratively improve the synthesis model for voice conversion, by creating a challenging training objective using self-synthesized examples. In this training approach, the current state of the synthesis model is used to generate voice-converted variations of an utterance, which serve as inputs for the reconstruction task, ensuring a continuous and purposeful refinement of the model. We demonstrate that incorporating such self-synthesized examples during training improves the speaker similarity of generated speech as compared to a baseline voice conversion model trained solely on heuristically perturbed inputs. Our framework is trained without any text and is applicable to a range of tasks such as zero-shot voice conversion, voice conversion across different languages, and controllable speech synthesis with pitch and pace modifications.

While some techniques [@defossez2022highfi; @eloff2019unsupervised; @singingspeechcodec; @kumar2023highfidelity] aim to compress speech into a data-efficient codec, another line of research has focused on disentangling the learned features into components such as speaker characteristics (voice or timbre), linguistic content (phonetic information) and prosodic information (pitch modulation and speaking rate)  [@chou2019one; @qian2019autovc; @wu2020one; @chen2021again; @qian2022contentvec; @hussain2023ace]. Representation disentanglement allows controllable speech synthesis by training a model to reconstruct the audio from the disentangled features. During inference, the relevant disentangled representations can be modified for performing tasks like voice conversion (changing the speaker of an utterance) or changing the prosody.\n\nTo derive disentangled speech representations in a text-free manner, recent methods [@lakhotia2021generative; @polyak2021speech; @lin2021fragmentvc; @huang2022s3prl; @choi2021neural] have proposed to obtain speaker information from a speaker verification model and linguistic content information from the output of models trained using self-supervised learning (SSL) [@wav2vec2; @gulati2020conformer]. While the representations obtained from SSL models are highly correlated with phonetic information, they also contain speaker information [@huang2022s3prl; @hussain2022multi]. To remove speaker information from the SSL model outputs, some techniques utilize an information bottleneck approach such as quantization [@polyak2021speech; @lakhotia2021generative; @gu2021mediumvc]. Alternatively, several researchers have proposed training strategies that employ an information perturbation technique to eliminate speaker information without quantization [@qian2022contentvec; @choi2021neural; @choi2023nansy; @hussain2023ace]. Notably, for training synthesizers, NANSY [@choi2021neural] and NANSY++ [@choi2023nansy] propose to heuristically perturb the voice of a given utterance with hand-engineered data augmentations, before obtaining the output from the SSL model. To reconstruct the original audio accurately, the synthesizer is forced to derive the speaker characteristics from the speaker embedding since the speaker information in the SSL model's output is perturbed. While such techniques are effective, heuristic voice perturbation algorithms based on pitch randomization and formant shifting represent a very limited set of transformations. We hypothesize that such training strategies can be improved by utilizing neural network-generated augmentations.\n\nWhile SSL based VC models do not require transcriptions during training, they lack the ability to explicitly control prosody due to the challenge of estimating durations from SSL features. Conversely, models that have the ability to explicitly control prosody lack the ability to use SSL, making it extremely hard to support multiple languages. What if we could combine the benefits of each approach to circumvent their weakness, and use iterative refinement to obtain better results?\n\nIn this work, we propose SelfVC, a learning framework to automatically generate diverse data transformations during training and enable controllable speech synthesis from imperfectly disentangled but uncompressed speech representations. First, we propose a feature extraction pipeline to derive SSL representations, speaker embeddings and prosodic information from a given audio signal. Next, we design a synthesis model to reconstruct a given utterance from the SSL features and speaker embedding, while using the fundamental frequency contour and duration as targets for training intermediate submodules. Finally, to train an effective voice conversion model, we propose a training strategy that utilizes the synthesis model itself to create challenging voice-converted transformations of a given speech utterance. At any given training iteration, the current state of the synthesis model is used to transform the input SSL features and the model is updated to minimize the reconstruction error of the original utterance.\n\nAll the components in our framework are trained in a text-free manner requiring only audio data. Once trained, our framework can be used for tasks such as zero-shot voice conversion, audio reconstruction with pitch and duration modulation as well as multilingual voice conversion across languages outside of the training set. On metrics evaluating speaker similarity, intelligibility and naturalness of synthesized speech we demonstrate that our model outperforms previously proposed zero-shot voice conversion methods. The main contributions of our work are:\n\n1.  We develop a training strategy using self transformations to train a voice conversion model on imperfectly disentangled representations, resulting in considerable improvement in speaker similarity metrics as compared to a model trained only with heuristic transformations.\n\n2.  We propose techniques to derive prosodic information from uncompressed SSL feature vectors and use the derived information to train a controllable synthesizer that can either mimic the prosody of a source utterance or adapt the prosody given a target speaker.\n\n3.  Our models are trained in a text-free manner and independent of phonetic posteriograms, hence making it simple and efficient to scale up the training data, including other languages.\n\n4.  SelfVC achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot any-to-any voice conversion in English. When fine-tuned on a few hours of multi-lingual data, SelfVC outperforms prior voice conversion methods on the cross-lingual voice conversion task."},{"heading":"Related work","text":"# Related work {#sec:related_work}\n\n**Voice conversion:** Voice conversion is the task of modifying an utterance of a source speaker to match the vocal qualities of a target speaker. Traditionally, voice conversion models were trained as a speech-to-speech translation system on a parallel dataset containing multiple speakers saying the same utterance [@sun2015dblstm; @chen2014dnn]. More recently, voice conversion systems have been developed by training neural synthesizers to reconstruct speech from disentangled representations describing linguistic content and speaker characteristics [@qian2019autovc; @chou2019one]. For example,  [@sun2016phonetic; @tian2018average] have utilized pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker verification (SV) models to disentangle content and speaker information respectively. The predicted text or phonetic posteriogram (PPG) obtained from the ASR model is taken as the content representation. However, such voice conversion systems have limitations: 1) Training such systems requires transcribed speech data and the synthesis is limited to the language the model is trained on. 2) Text and PPG do not capture all linguistic features such as accent, expressions, emotions or speaker-independent style resulting in neutral-sounding synthesized speech.\n\nTo derive linguistic content in a text-free manner, some prior works have utilized SSL based models. However, as noted by prior work [@polyak2021speech; @huang2022s3prl], SSL model outputs do not necessarily separate speaker and content information. One line of research [@polyak2021speech; @lee2021voicemixer; @lakhotia2021generative; @gu2021mediumvc] aiming to disentangle the speaker and content representations, proposes an information bottleneck approach to quantize SSL model outputs thereby limiting the information to only capture the content or pseudo-text of the audio. However, the loss of information during such a quantization approach leads to sub-optimal reconstruction quality. Moreover, information bottleneck by itself does not guarantee disentanglement.\n\nAddressing the limitations of information bottleneck approaches, researchers have proposed training strategies based on heuristic transformations. For example, in ContentVec [@qian2022contentvec] and ACE-VC [@hussain2023ace], while training the SSL-based feature extractor model, the audio is transformed using pitch-shift transformation and the SSL model is trained to output similar representations for the original and transformed audio. Alternatively, in NANSY [@choi2021neural], the transformations are applied while training the synthesizer, i.e. the synthesizer is tasked to reconstruct the original audio from the speaker embedding of the original audio and the SSL features of audio perturbed using transforms such as formant-shift, pitch-randomization and randomized frequency shaping. Although these heuristic transformations serve as a reasonable proxy for voice conversion methods, we hypothesize such methods can be greatly improved by utilizing the voice conversion system itself to generate more diverse input transformations.\n\n**Transformation invariant representation learning:** In unsupervised representation learning, prior work has investigated methods to learn representations that are invariant to various input transformations [@bachman2019learning; @misra2020self]. Several techniques addressing this challenge utilize domain-specific and hand-engineered data augmentation methods for training transformation invariant representation encoders [@chen2020simple; @caron2020unsupervised; @tian2020makes; @grill2020bootstrap; @misra2020self]. More recently, [@tamkinviewmaker] proposed to train generative models to produce diverse views from a given input by adding a bounded perturbation. Their results demonstrate that neural generative models can produce a more diverse set of input distortions (compared to hand-engineered augmentations) without requiring domain-specific knowledge. While these techniques have proven valuable for learning transformation-invariant representations in downstream recognition tasks, their applicability in upstream generative tasks remains unexplored. In contrast, we develop a novel framework for training a controllable synthesis model using self-generated input transformations, without the need for additional networks for data augmentation."},{"heading":"Method","text":"# Method {#sec:methodology}\n\nOur goal is to design a voice conversion framework that can modify the voice of a given utterance, while also providing control over the prosody of the synthesized speech. To this end, our framework consists of two main components: (1) A feature extractor that derives content (linguistic features), speaker embedding and prosody information from a given speech utterance (Section [3.1](#sec:featureextraction){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:featureextraction\"}); and (2) A synthesizer model that reconstructs the audio from the derived representations (Section [3.2](#sec:synth){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:synth\"}). To allow controllable synthesis from imperfectly disentangled representations, we propose a training strategy that challenges the model to reconstruct the audio from self-generated perturbations of the content representation (Section [3.3](#sec:selfrefine){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:selfrefine\"}). Specifically, we train the model to reconstruct the audio from the content representation of a heuristically modified or self transformed audio, while preserving the speaker and style representations. The content and speaker encoder networks remain frozen during synthesis model training. Figure [1](#figs:maindiag){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"figs:maindiag\"} provides an overview of our voice conversion framework and the synthesizer training procedure.\n\n## Feature Extraction {#sec:featureextraction}\n\nThe overview of the feature extraction pipeline is shown in Figure [2](#figs:extractorsynthesizer){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"figs:extractorsynthesizer\"} (a). We derive the following features from an audio signal to train our synthesis models.\n\n**Content Embedding:** We define content as a temporal feature that encodes the linguistic information of a given speech utterance. We use the output of the Conformer-SSL [@gulati2020conformer] model ($G_c$) as the content representation of speech ($z$). The Conformer-SSL model is a convolution-augmented transformer architecture that is trained to reconstruct the masked areas of the mel-spectrogram on English speech data, using contrastive and masked language modelling (MLM) losses (Refer to Appendix [7](#sec:modelarch){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:modelarch\"} for model details). Given a speech utterance as a sequence of mel-spectrogram frames $x=x_1 \\dots x_T$, the Conformer-SSL model outputs a temporally downsampled sequence of feature vectors $z=G_c(x)=z_1 \\dots z_{T'}$. While $z$ primarily encodes phonetic information, it also encompasses speaker and prosodic information. We explain our approach to address this challenge for training a voice conversion model in Section [3.3](#sec:selfrefine){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:selfrefine\"}.\n\n![SelfVC Overview: The synthesizer $G_{\\textit{synth}}$ is trained to reconstruct the mel-spectrogram from SSL-based content representation of a transformed audio and speaker embedding of the original audio. The transformation function is either a heuristic transform or a voice-converted audio generated using self-synthesis with a different speaker embedding. ](figures/NeuripsMainDiagram_ver3.pdf){#figs:maindiag width=\"80%\"}\n\n**Duration:** Duration or rhythm characterizes the speaking rate at a granular level, that is, how long the speaker vocalizes each phoneme of a given utterance. Accurate modelling of rhythm during synthesis is important to capture the nuances between the different speakers, accents and emotions. Since SSL representations have a high correlation with phonemes [@wav2vec2; @gulati2020conformer], we conjecture that if a phoneme is emphasized in an utterance, the consecutive content vectors at the corresponding timesteps will have high similarity. Therefore, we group together consecutive content vectors with cosine similarity higher than a threshold $\\tau$, and set the target duration for the averaged vector as the number of grouped vectors multiplied by the duration of a single vector. That is, we process the content representation $z=z_1 \\dots z_{T'}$ into a duration-augmented content representation $z'=z'_1 \\dots z'_{\\hat{T}}$ and $d'=d'_1 \\dots d'_{\\hat{T}}$ where $\\hat{T} \\leq T'$ and $d'_{t}$ represents the duration of $z'_{t}$. This similarity based grouping approach is analogous to prior approaches [@lee2021voicemixer; @qian2021global]. We refer readers to Algorithm [\\[alg:grouping\\]](#alg:grouping){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"alg:grouping\"} in the Appendix which details our approach to obtain $z', d'$ and highlights key differences with prior methods.\n\n**Speaker Embedding:** The speaker embeddings in our setup are derived from the TitaNet [@titanet22] speaker verification model ($G_s$). The speaker verification model is trained to differentiate speakers and generate similar embeddings for utterances from the same speaker. The output from the TitaNet speaker verification model is a $192$ dimensional speaker embedding $s=G_s(x)$. We provide more details on this model in the Appendix [7](#sec:modelarch){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:modelarch\"}.\n\n**Pitch Contour:** The pitch contour $p$ is derived from the fundamental frequency $f_0$ contour of the speech signal that represents the prosodic modulations over time. The raw values in the fundamental frequency contour (derived from PYin algorithm [@pyin]) are speaker-dependent, therefore $f_0$ is not strictly disentangled from the speaker information. To ensure that the pitch contour only encodes the intonation and not the speaker identity, we normalize $f_0$ using the mean ($f_{\\textit{mean}}$) and standard deviation ($f_{\\textit{std}}$) of all pitch contours of the given speaker. That is, $p=(f_0 - f_{\\textit{mean}})/f_{\\textit{std}}$.\n\n## Synthesizer {#sec:synth}\n\nThe task of the synthesizer is to first reconstruct the ground-truth mel-spectrogram from the extracted speech representations and then vocode the mel-spectrogram into a listenable audio waveform. For vocoding, we use a HiFiGAN [@kong2020hifi] vocoder, which is trained separately on spectrogram and waveform pairs from a multi-speaker dataset.\n\nOur mel-spectrogram synthesizer $G_{\\textit{synth}}$ is composed of two feed-forward transformers $F_e$ and $F_d$ and intermediate modules to predict the duration and pitch contour similar to [@lancucki2021fastpitch] but operates on the grouped content representation $z'=z'_1 \\dots z'_{T'}$ instead of text. The speaker embedding $s$ is repeated across all time-steps and concatenated with each $z'_t$ to be fed as input to the first feed-forward transformer $F_e$. The hidden representation from $F_e$ is then used to predict the duration and pitch contour, that is: $h=F_e(z', s)$; $\\hat{y_d} = \\textit{DurationPredictor}(h)$, $\\hat{y_p} = \\textit{PitchPredictor}(h)$. The pitch contour is projected and averaged over each time-step of the hidden representation $h$ and added to $h$ to get $k = h + \\textit{PitchEmbedding}(p)$. Finally, $k$ is discretely upsampled as per the ground-truth duration $d'$ and fed as input to the second transformer $F_d$ to get the predicted mel-spectrogram $\\hat{y} = F_d( \\textit{DurationRegulation}(k, d') )$. Our model is trained to optimize three losses --- mel-reconstruction error, pitch prediction error and duration prediction error such that $$L_\\textit{synth} = \\lVert \\hat{{y}} - {y}\\rVert^2_2 + \n    \\lambda_1      \\lVert \\hat{{y_p}} - {p}\\rVert^2_2 + \n    \\lambda_2      \\lVert \\hat{{y_d}} - {d'}\\rVert^2_2 \n\\label{eq:trainingobjective}$$\n\nDuring inference, we can use either the predicted pitch and duration, in which case the prosody is derived from both the content and speaker embeddings; or we can mimic the prosody and speaking rate of the source utterance by using ground-truth duration and pitch.\n\n![(a) Feature Extraction: The feature extractor derives the duration augmented content information from an SSL model, pitch contour using PYin algorithm and speaker embedding from a speaker verification model. (b) Mel Spectrogram Synthesizer: reconstructs the mel-spectrogram from the derived features. ](figures/NeuripsFeatureExtractor_horiz.pdf){#figs:extractorsynthesizer width=\"80%\"}\n\n## Synthesizer Training: Iterative Refinement using Self Transformations {#sec:selfrefine}\n\nWhile the mel-spectrogram can be accurately reconstructed from a synthesizer trained using the objective given by Equation [\\[eq:trainingobjective\\]](#eq:trainingobjective){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"eq:trainingobjective\"}, during inference, we cannot effectively modify the voice of a given utterance. This is because the content representation $z'$ is not strictly disentangled from the speaker information. To address this challenge, past works [@choi2021neural; @choi2023nansy], have proposed an information perturbation based training strategy as follows: Instead of feeding the content embedding of the original audio as the input, the audio is perturbed to synthetically modify the speaker characteristics using formant-shifting, pitch-randomization and randomized frequency shaping transforms to obtain $x_{p}=g_{\\textit{heuristic}}(x)$. Next, the content embedding is derived from the perturbed audio $z'=G_{c}(x_{p})$, while the speaker embedding is still derived from the original audio $s=G_s(x)$. The network is then tasked to reconstruct the original audio from $z'$ and $s$. While heuristically perturbed content representations play a crucial role in enhancing the synthesizer model's attention towards the speaker embedding, they are limited in terms of the range of transformations they can introduce. Heuristic transformations represent only a subset of the potential natural variations that can occur during voice conversion.\n\nTo expand on the heuristic set of transforms, we propose to utilize the synthesizer model itself to generate a voice-converted variation of a given utterance $x$. That is, given a synthesizer model $G_{\\textit{synth}}^i$ trained until training iteration $i$, we obtain a self transformed audio for iteration $i+1$ as: $$\\begin{aligned}\n& x_p=g_{\\textit{self}}(x) = G_{\\textit{synth}}^i( G_{c}(x), s') \n\\label{eq:selftransform}\n\\end{aligned}$$ where $G_{c}(x)$ is the content embedding of the original audio $x$ and $s'$ is the speaker embedding obtained from an utterance $x'$ of a different randomly selected speaker, that is, $s'=G_s(x')$. The content embedding input for the training step $i+1$ is then derived as $z'=G_{c}(x_{p})$.\n\nSelf transformations not only provide a more diverse set of transformations but also present an increasingly challenging reconstruction task for the synthesizer, as its voice conversion capabilities improve with each training iteration. Figure [1](#figs:maindiag){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"figs:maindiag\"} demonstrates the proposed self transformation training strategy. In our experiments, we begin self transformations after $100k$ mini-batch iterations of training with heuristically modified audio. Thereafter, we get a reasonable initialization for a voice conversion model, and we start using self transformations to obtain $x_p$ as per Equation [\\[eq:selftransform\\]](#eq:selftransform){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"eq:selftransform\"}."},{"heading":"Experiments","text":"# Experiments {#sec:experiments}\n\n::: table*\n[]{#tab:reconstruction label=\"tab:reconstruction\"}\n:::\n\n## Dataset and Training {#datasettraining}\n\nThe Conformer-SSL model used as the content encoder is pretrained on $56k$ hours of unlabelled English speech from the LibriLight [@librilight] corpus sampled at $16$ KHz. We fine-tune the Conformer-SSL model (using self-supervision with contrastive and MLM loss) on the *train-clean-360* subset of LibriTTS [@zen2019libritts] dataset with audio sampled at $22050\\mathit{Hz}$ to make the model compatible with the mel-spectrogram representation of the synthesizer. For both the content encoder and synthesizer, we use $80$ bands for mel spectrogram with the FFT, window, and hop size set to $1024$, $1024$, and $256$ respectively. We fine-tune the Conformer-SSL on this revised spectrogram representation for $50$ epochs with a batch size of $32$ using the AdamW optimizer with a fixed learning rate of $5e-5$ and $\\beta_1=0.9, \\beta_2=0.99$. Fine-tuning takes around $50$ hours on a single NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU.\n\nFor our primary experiments, the mel-spectrogram synthesizer and the HifiGAN vocoder are also trained on the train-clean-360 subset of the LibriTTS dataset which contains $360$ hours of speech from $904$ speakers. We train three variants of the mel-spectrogram synthesizer:\\\n**1. Baseline--NoTransform** is trained to simply reconstruct the mel-spectrogram from the embeddings of the given utterance without any information perturbation procedure.\\\n**2. Baseline--Heuristic** is trained to reconstruct the mel-spectrogram from the content embedding of the heuristically perturbed utterance and the speaker embedding of the original utterance. We employ two transforms $g_1, g_2$ proposed in [@choi2021neural]. $g_1$ perturbs formant, pitch, and frequency response and $g_2$ perturbs formant and frequency response while preserving pitch. The hyperparameter details of these transformations are provided in the Appendix [8](#sec:heuristicfunctions){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:heuristicfunctions\"}.\\\n**3. SelfVC** is first trained in the same way as Baseline--Heuristic for the first $100k$ mini batch iterations. Thereafter, we use the $g_\\textit{self}$ transformation procedure given by Equation [\\[eq:selftransform\\]](#eq:selftransform){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"eq:selftransform\"}.\n\nWe point readers to Appendix [7](#sec:modelarch){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:modelarch\"} for detailed architectures and training details of various components.\n\n::: table*\n[]{#tab:voiceconversion label=\"tab:voiceconversion\"}\n:::\n\n## Evaluation Metrics {#sec:metrics}\n\nWe encourage readers to listen to our audio examples linked in the footnote on the first page. Quantitatively, we evaluate the synthesized audio on the following aspects:\n\n**Intelligibility:** For intelligibility, we transcribe the synthesized and original through and ASR and compute two error metrics between the transcriptions --- Character Error Rate **(CER)** and Phoneme Error Rate **(PER)**. For CER, we transcribe the audio using the Quartznet [@kriman2020quartznet] ASR model. For multilingual evaluation, we compute the PER on the transcriptions obtained from the pre-trained wav2vec2-Large-XLSR-53 ASR model which has been trained to recognize phonetic labels in multiple languages. [@Xu2021SimpleAE]. We also report the CER and PER between the predicted and ground truth transcripts of real data for reference in our Results.\n\n**Speaker Similarity Metrics:** To evaluate speaker similarity to our target speaker, we compute the speaker embeddings of synthesized and real utterances using a separate pre-trained speaker verification model [@koluguri2020speakernet]. Then we pair the synthesized and real utterances to create an equal number of positive (same-speaker) and negative (alternate-speaker) pairs for each target speaker to compute the Equal Error Rate **(SV-EER)**. We also report the mean cosine similarity between the positive pairs **(SV-SIM)**. Finally, we also ask human listeners to rate the speaker similarity of the generated and real utterance from the target speaker on a 5-point scale to obtain **Sim-MOS**.\n\n**Naturalness (MOS):** We ask human listeners to rate the naturalness of each utterance on a $1$ to $5$ scale with $1$ point increments. We include details of *MOS* and *SIM-MOS* evaluations in Appendix [11](#sec:humaneval){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:humaneval\"}\n\n**Prosodic Similarity (GPE):** To evaluate prosodic similarity for the reconstruction task (Section [4.3](#sec:Reconstruction){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:Reconstruction\"}), we compute error between the fundamental frequency contours of the original and synthesized audio. Specifically, we use Gross Pitch Error (GPE) [@chu2009reducing] to evaluate prosodic similarity.\n\n## Reconstruction {#sec:Reconstruction}\n\nFirst, we evaluate how effectively our setup can reconstruct audio from the extracted representations for unseen utterances and speakers. Our synthesizers can operate in two modes during inference --- *1) **Guided:*** In this scenario, we use ground truth pitch and duration information derived from the source utterance. *2) **Predictive:*** In this case, we use the predicted pitch and duration for synthesis. We conduct the reconstruction test on two unseen datasets --- 1) We choose $200$ utterances from the VCTK [@yamagishi2019vctk] dataset (English) with $20$ random utterances from each of the $10$ speakers ($5$ random male and $5$ random female speakers); 2) To evaluate performance on unseen languages, we choose $200$ utterances from the CSS10 [@park2019css10] dataset with $20$ random utterances from each of the $10$ unseen languages. The CSS10 dataset has a single speaker per language and contains at least $4$ hours of speech per language. For both of these evaluations, we use the synthesizer models trained on the same dataset, i.e. train-clean-360 subset of LibriTTS (English). The synthesized speech is evaluated on the intelligibility, speaker similarity and prosodic similarity metrics.\n\nAs indicated by the results in Table [\\[tab:reconstruction\\]](#tab:reconstruction){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"tab:reconstruction\"}, all three synthesizers achieve similar performance on the above metrics. This is expected since the speaker and content embedding are derived from the same utterance and all three synthesizers are trained for the reconstruction task. However, for controllable synthesis tasks such as voice conversion, we demonstrate that SelfVC considerably outperforms these baselines (Section [4.4](#sec:vcresults){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:vcresults\"}). Since our model is trained in a text-free manner, we also see a promising generalization to unseen languages. The PER on CSS10 is higher than VCTK due to the larger phonetic vocabulary in non-English languages and the PER of the wav2vec2 model [@Xu2021SimpleAE] being higher even on real data. For unseen languages, our synthesizers produce more intelligible speech in the guided mode, where the duration information of the source utterance is kept intact.\n\n## Voice Conversion {#sec:vcresults}\n\nTo convert the voice of a given source utterance to a target speaker, we derive the content embedding from the source utterance and estimate the speaker embedding from the target speaker's audio and feed both as input to the synthesizer. To compare our zero-shot voice conversion method against prior work, we choose utterances from the LibriTTS test-clean subset since it is an unseen dataset across all voice conversion methods. We randomly choose $10$ target speakers ($5$ male and $5$ female) and $20$ source utterances from the remaining speakers to create $200$ voice conversion trials for each technique and report the results in Table [\\[tab:voiceconversion\\]](#tab:voiceconversion){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"tab:voiceconversion\"}. For our primary evaluation, we use $10$ seconds of speech from each target speaker to derive the speaker embedding. We split the $10$ second target-speaker utterance into $2$ second segments and estimate the speaker embedding as the mean speaker embedding across the segments. To be consistent with past work, we keep the duration of the source utterance unchanged during synthesis using duration guided mode and use predictive mode for pitch. We evaluate speaker-similarity across varying target speaker data amounts, with results detailed in Figure [3](#figs:speakergraphs){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"figs:speakergraphs\"} of the Appendix. Additionally, we include voice conversion results on seen speakers and out-of-domain VCTK dataset in Appendix [9](#sec:additionalvc){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:additionalvc\"}.\n\n**Effectiveness of Self Transformations:** We perform ablations to compare effectiveness of different input transformation techniques. As reported in Table [\\[tab:voiceconversion\\]](#tab:voiceconversion){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"tab:voiceconversion\"}, incorporating heuristic transformations during training (Baseline--Heuristic) improves speaker similarity of generated audio over a baseline that does not use any transformations (Baseline--NoTransform). The speaker similarity metrics (SV-EER, SV-Sim and Sim-MOS) further improve in SelfVC when we incorporate the self transformation based iterative refinement procedure (Section [3.3](#sec:selfrefine){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:selfrefine\"}). Note that both the baseline techniques and the SelfVC approach use identical neural architectures and undergo training for the same number of epochs with consistent optimizer hyperparameters. While Baseline-NoTransform produces intelligible and natural sounding audio, it clearly lacks in speaker similarity metrics, emphasizing the significance of input transformation methods in voice conversion.\n\n::: table*\n[]{#tab:crosslingual label=\"tab:crosslingual\"}\n:::\n\n**Comparison against Prior Work:** Although we have conducted controlled experiments by varying input transformation techniques in our models, it is challenging to make similar comparisons with prior research due to disparities in vocoders, datasets, and compatibility of model architectures between synthesizers and vocoders. We use the official open-source implementations and model checkpoints of six previously proposed techniques. For a fair comparison, we evaluate all prior techniques on the same voice conversion trial pairs as our methods, using the same ASR and SV models for calculating CER, PER and SV metrics. While NANSY [@choi2023nansy] is not officially open-sourced, our Baseline--Heuristic method closely follows the training strategy proposed in NANSY using the same hyperparameters for heuristic functions (Appendix [8](#sec:heuristicfunctions){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:heuristicfunctions\"}), incorporating more recent neural architectures for the synthesizer and feature extractors. As shown in Table [\\[tab:voiceconversion\\]](#tab:voiceconversion){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"tab:voiceconversion\"}, SelfVC outperforms previously proposed voice conversion models on all quantitative metrics. It is interesting to note that SelfVC trained on just the train-clean-360 subset of LibriTTS outperforms YourTTS which is trained on a much larger dataset comprising LibirTTS (train-clean-360, train-clean-100), VCTK and two additional languages (French and Portugese).\n\n**Cross-lingual Voice Conversion:** For Cross-lingual voice conversion, we use the CSS10 dataset that contains speech utterances from $10$ different languages. We consider three voice conversion scenarios: 1) **English to CSS10:** Source utterance is from the test-clean subset of LibriTTS (English) and target speaker is from the CSS10 dataset 2) **CSS10 to CSS10:** Source utterance from a language in the CSS10 dataset and target speaker is from another language of CSS10. 3) **CSS10 to English:** Source utterance from a language in the CSS10 dataset and target speaker is from LibriTTS (English).\n\nFor *English to CSS10* we create $200$ voice conversion trials considering $20$ source utterances and $10$ target speakers in CSS10. For *CSS10 to CSS10* and *CSS10 to English*, we generate $500$ voice conversion trials each, considering $50$ source utterances ($5$ each from the $10$ languages) and $10$ target speakers. We use $10$ seconds of target speaker data across all experiments. We compare different voice conversion techniques on these trial pairs and present the results in Table [\\[tab:crosslingual\\]](#tab:crosslingual){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"tab:crosslingual\"}.\n\nIn the *English to CSS10* experiments, SelfVC (LibriTTS), which is trained solely on train-clean-360 LibriTTS subset, outperforms baseline methods and prior work, achieving lower SV-EER and PER. It is interesting to note that SelfVC (LibriTTS) outperforms YourTTS, which is trained on a more extensive trilingual dataset as discussed above. For *CSS10 to CSS10* voice conversion, we observe a higher SV-EER and PER for SelfVC (LibriTTS) as compared to YourTTS. This is not very surprising, since YourTTS model was trained on multilingual speech data while SelfVC (LibriTTS) has only been trained on English speech. For *CSS10 to English* voice conversion, SelfVC (LibriTTS) outperforms all baselines and prior work. Interestingly, ACE-VC, which uses similar model architectures and the same training data as our setup, does not generate intelligible speech when the source utterance is from CSS10. This result indicates that the text-free nature of our model allows generalization to unseen languages.\n\nTo adapt SelfVC for new languages, we conduct fine-tuning of only the synthesis model on both LibriTTS (train-clean-360) and CSS10 utterances (using data other than the test trial pairs), which considerably improves SV-EER and PER for the SelfVC (LibriTTS + CSS10) model. The improvement in SV-EER is significant but not surprising since the $10$ CSS10 speakers are now seen during training in the SelfVC (LibriTTS + CSS10) model. The improvement in PER is promising and demonstrates the effective adaptability of our model to different languages. We delve into details of the finetuning process and report the phoneme error rates for each of the $10$ CSS10 languages in Appendix [10](#sec:languagewiseper){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"sec:languagewiseper\"}."},{"heading":"Conclusion","text":"# Conclusion {#sec:discussion}\n\nWe introduce a novel training strategy, SelfVC, that utilizes self transformations to train controllable synthesis models on imperfectly disentangled representations. Our results indicate a clear benefit of incorporating self-synthesized examples while training a voice conversion model, as shown by a significant improvement in speaker similarity metrics while keeping the model architecture unchanged. By deriving and modelling prosodic information during training, SelfVC allows for both fine-grained and high-level control over the prosody of the synthesized speech. SelfVC achieves SOTA results in zero-shot voice conversion for English and can be easily scaled to multiple languages in a text-free manner, outperforming prior approaches in cross-lingual voice conversion. We recommend future work to apply our training strategy in other data domains for creating controllable synthesis models.\n\n[]{#sec:references label=\"sec:references\"}"},{"heading":"Deriving Duration-augmented Content Embeddings","text":"# Deriving Duration-augmented Content Embeddings\n\nGiven the output $z = G_c(x) = z_1 \\dots z_T$ from the Conformer-SSL model, we group together consecutive feature vectors with high cosine similarity.

The original duration $\\delta$ of a single vector is $4$ mel-spectrogram frames or $46$ms or raw audio. This procedure differs slightly from previous work [@lee2021voicemixer] in that, instead of computing similarities between consecutive pairs of the original vectors, we now compare the average embedding of the current group with the next original embedding. Our temporal downsampling procedure is similar to [@qian2021global] but we additionally maintain the durations of the grouped vectors to be used as targets for the duration predictor in our synthesizer. Our technique also differs from prior work [@kreuk-etal-2022-textless; @maimon2022speaking] that obtains duration/rhythm information from discrete SSL representations instead of the continuous vectors.

Total number of parameters and inference latency for each model are listed in Table [1](#tab:modelsize){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"tab:modelsize\"}\n\n**Conformer-SSL Model:** The Conformer-SSL model [@gulati2020conformer] used in this work is a convolution-augmented transformer architecture that is trained to reconstruct the masked areas of the mel-spectrogram on English speech data, using contrastive and masked language modelling (MLM) losses. It is pre-trained on the LibriLight corpus which consists of $56$k hrs of unlabeled English speech. The model consists of $18$ layers, $8$ attention heads and a hidden dimension of $512$. The output head of the Conformer model gives a $256$ dimensional encoding per timestep. The model temporally downsamples the input mel-spectrogram by a factor of $4$. With the STFT parameters used in our setup, each vector from the Conformer-SSL model corresponds to a contextualized representation of $46$ms of audio.\n\n**Speaker Verification TitaNet Model:** TitaNet [@titanet22] is based on a 1-D depthwise separable convolution architecture with Squeeze and Excitation layers that provide global context, followed by channel attention-based statistics pooling layer to map variable-length utterances to a fixed-length embedding. The TitaNet speaker verification model is trained using additive angular margin loss [@Liu_2017_CVPR] on $3373$ hours of speech from multiple datasets that span $16681$ speakers. Comprising of $25.3$ million parameters, the TitaNet model is designed to be parameter-efficient and achieves state-of-the-art results on the VoxCeleb-1 speaker verification benchmark with an EER of $0.68\\%$. The output from this speaker verification model is a $192$ dimensional speaker embedding.\n\n**Mel-spectrogram Synthesizer:** The spectrogram synthesizer takes as input the content and speaker embeddings and predicts the mel-spectrogram. The speaker and content embeddings derived from the Conformer-SSL and TitaNet models respectively are first projected to $256$ dimensions each using a learnable linear layer. The projected speaker embedding is then repeated across all time-steps and concatenated with the projected content embeddings. The synthesizer is a FastPitch [@lancucki2021fastpitch] based model that contains two feed forward transformer networks (encoder and decoder) that follow an identical architecture. Each transformer network contains $6$ layers, with a hidden dimension of $1536$. Each layer is composed of a single-headed attention module with an attention head of size $64$ followed by a 1-d convolutional block. Each convolutional block is a sequential operation of Conv1d, ReLU, Conv1d, Dropout and Layer Normalization. The kernel size for the convolution is $3$ and dropout probability is $0.1$.\n\nThe mel-spectrogram synthesizer also contains two submodules for predicting pitch and duration. The pitch and duration predictors take as input the output of the encoder network and predict a sequence of scalar values for duration or pitch (speaker normalized $F_0$ contour). Duration is used to regulate the length of the encoder output and pitch is embedded and concatenated with the encoder's output to be fed as input to the decoder. Both the pitch and duration predictor follow the same architecture --- Each network contains two convolutional blocks. Each convolutional block is a serial composition of Conv1d, ReLU and layer normalization with a kernel size of $3$ and hidden dimension of $256$, followed by a linear layer that maps the hidden dimension to a scalar value for duration or pitch.\n\nAll three variants of the synthesizer listed in Section [4.1](#datasettraining){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"datasettraining\"} are optimized using an AdamW optimizer [@loshchilov2018decoupled] with a fixed learning rate of $1e-4$ and $\\beta_1=0.8, \\beta_2=0.99$ for $500$ epochs with a batch size of $32$. The threshold $\\tau$ for duration extraction is set as $0.925$. The loss coefficients for the duration and pitch loss are set as $\\lambda_1=\\lambda_2=0.1$. The training time for Synth (SelfTransform) model is around $5$ days on $4$ NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs.\n\n**HiFiGAN Vocoder:** The HiFi-GAN [@kong2020hifi] vocoder used in this work consists of one generator and two discriminators: multi-scale and multi-period discriminators. In the generator network, consists of $4$ upsampling blocks with an upsampling factor of $8$, $8$, $2$, $2$ with kernel sizes $16$, $16$, $4$, $4$ respectively. The model outputs audio at $22050$Hz. The HiFiGAN vocoder is trained for $350$ epochs on train-clean-360 subset of LibriTTS. Thereafter, the vocoder is additionally fine-tuned on synthetic mel-spectrograms, generated by the three mel-spectrogram synthesizers (Baseline-NoTransform, Baseline-Heuristic and SelfVC) for the same dataset for $5$ epochs.\n\n::: {#tab:modelsize}\n  ----------------------------- --------------- ------------------ ------\n                                                  *Inference Time* \n                                                       *(Seconds)* \n  Model                           \\# Parameters                CPU    GPU\n  Speaker Encoder TiTaNet                  25 M               0.13   0.05\n  Conformer-SSL                           121 M               0.44   0.10\n  Mel-Spectrogram Synthesizer              59 M               0.15   0.01\n  HiFiGAN Vocoder                          85 M                2.1   0.08\n  ----------------------------- --------------- ------------------ ------\n\n  : Model size and wall clock inference time for a speech utterance of length $10$ seconds using a batch size of $1$ on CPU and NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU.\n:::\n\n[]{#tab:modelsize label=\"tab:modelsize\"}"},{"heading":"Heuristic transformation functions","text":"# Heuristic transformation functions {#sec:heuristicfunctions}\n\nFor heuristic transformations, we follow the perturbation functions and hyperparameters proposed in [@choi2023nansy].

In this work, instead of explicitly disentangling attributes with loss terms, we present a framework to train a controllable voice conversion model on entangled speech representations derived from self-supervised learning (SSL) and speaker verification models. First, we develop techniques to derive prosodic information from the audio signal and SSL representations to train predictive submodules in the synthesis model. Next, we propose a training strategy to iteratively improve the synthesis model for voice conversion, by creating a challenging training objective using self-synthesized examples. In this training approach, the current state of the synthesis model is used to generate voice-converted variations of an utterance, which serve as inputs for the reconstruction task, ensuring a continuous and purposeful refinement of the model. We demonstrate that incorporating such self-synthesized examples during training improves the speaker similarity of generated speech as compared to a baseline voice conversion model trained solely on heuristically perturbed inputs. Our framework is trained without any text and is applicable to a range of tasks such as zero-shot voice conversion, voice conversion across different languages, and controllable speech synthesis with pitch and pace modifications.

The Bradley-Terry (BT) model stands as the prevalent choice for capturing human preferences from datasets containing pairs of chosen and rejected responses. In preference modeling, the focus is not on absolute values but rather on the reward difference between chosen and rejected responses, referred to as preference strength. Thus, precise evaluation of preference strength holds paramount importance in preference modeling. However, an easily overlooked factor significantly affecting preference strength measurement is that human attitudes towards two responses may not solely indicate a preference for one over the other and ties are also a common occurrence. To address this, we propose the adoption of the generalized Bradley-Terry model -- the Bradley-Terry model with ties (BTT) -- to accommodate tied preferences, thus leveraging additional information. We prove that even with the access to the true distributions of prompt and response, disregarding ties can lead to a notable bias in preference strength measurement. Comprehensive experiments further validate the advantages of incorporating ties in preference modeling.

Our experiments show that DPO can fine-tune LMs to align with human preferences as well as or better than existing methods.

The Bradley-Terry (BT) model stands as the prevalent choice for capturing human preferences from datasets containing pairs of chosen and rejected responses. In preference modeling, the focus is not on absolute values but rather on the reward difference between chosen and rejected responses, referred to as preference strength. Thus, precise evaluation of preference strength holds paramount importance in preference modeling. However, an easily overlooked factor significantly affecting preference strength measurement is that human attitudes towards two responses may not solely indicate a preference for one over the other and ties are also a common occurrence. To address this, we propose the adoption of the generalized Bradley-Terry model -- the Bradley-Terry model with ties (BTT) -- to accommodate tied preferences, thus leveraging additional information. We prove that even with the access to the true distributions of prompt and response, disregarding ties can lead to a notable bias in preference strength measurement. Comprehensive experiments further validate the advantages of incorporating ties in preference modeling.

A crucial component of the RLHF process is the reward model, which serves as the primary mechanism for integrating human preferences and feedback into the learning process [@wang2024secrets]. The reward model guides the optimization procedure of RLHF towards objectives aligned with human preferences [@kaufmann2023survey]. Therefore, the accuracy of the reward model greatly affects or even determines the effectiveness of alignment with human preferences. Moreover, the direct preference optimization (DPO) method [@rafailov2024direct] utilizes LLMs to implicitly represent the reward model through mathematical transformations, bypassing the complex RL optimization phase and focusing solely on the reward modeling phase. As a simplified alternative to RLHF, DPO has demonstrated computational efficiency and competitive performance compared to RLHF.\n\nTo learn a reward model from human preferences, obtaining high-quality human preference data is crucial [@wang2024secrets], typically achieved by having human labelers annotate previously collected data consisting of a prompt and a pair of responses [@ouyang2022training; @bai2022training]. We note that conventional approaches [@rafailov2024direct; @ziegler2019fine; @stiennon2020learning] often assume that the latent human preference model follows the Bradley-Terry (BT) [@bradley1952rank] model, where the preference distribution can be expressed as: $$p_r\\left(y_1 \\succ y_2 \\mid x\\right)=\\frac{\\exp \\left(r\\left(x, y_1\\right)\\right)}{\\exp \\left(r\\left(x, y_1\\right)\\right)+\\exp \\left(r\\left(x, y_2\\right)\\right)} = \\sigma (-\\Delta r)$$ where $r$ is the latent reward model, $\\sigma$ is sigmoid function, and $\\Delta r = r(x,y_1) - r(x, y_2)$ is preference strength. Consequently, human labelers are presented with only two options for each prompt $x$ and pair of responses $y_1$ and $y_2$: either $y_1$ is preferred or $y_2$ is preferred. However, this approach does not fully align with human attitudes towards preferences, as humans often perceive two responses as ties when their rewards have very little difference. To illustrate this point, we refer to the findings of @wang2024secrets due to the scarcity of preference datasets including ties. In their study, $10$ different reward models are trained on Anthropic's HH-RLHF [@bai2022training] dataset assuming the BT preference model. The mean and standard deviation of these $10$ reward models can partially reflect the real human preferences of this dataset. From the results of @wang2024secrets, the absolute value of the preference strength for a large amount of data is close to $0$, indicating that the preference difference in these cases is minimal and the pair of responses can often be considered as ties. We provide examples of data with small absolute mean preference strength in [1](#data_examples){reference-type=\"ref+label\" reference=\"data_examples\"} to further emphasize the importance of introducing ties in preferences.\n\n::: {#data_examples}\n  Prompt                **Can you help me set up an outdoor running routine so that I can get in shape?**\n  --------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Chosen Response       What kind of running are you interested in?\n  Rejected Response     Sure, what kind of program are you looking for?\n  Preference Strength   Mean : 0.0027, Standard Deviation: 0.22\n  Prompt                **Can you tell me what the meaning and themes are of the book Oliver Twist**\n  Chosen Response       Sure, here are some common themes, and there are a few interpretations that scholars have proposed: - the evil and temptations of London, - the books portray Oliver as a victim of the harsh society, - Oliver is also a victim of his situation, - the story is an attack on\n  Rejected Response     The meaning of the book is about the theme of being homeless and being poor.

We demonstrate that if we blindly adopt BT as our preference model (with the true latent preference model being BTT) can lead to significant bias in measuring preference strength due to model mismatch. To illustrate the model mismatch problem occurring in conventional preference datasets lacking ties when simply assuming the latent preference model is BT, we first introduce a simulated preference generation procedure. Specifically, we generate two preference datasets---one with ties and one without ties. By analyzing the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) based on BTT and BT preference models on these datasets respectively, we quantify the bias in measuring preference strength due to the model mismatch. Furthermore, we show that although the bias term is bounded, it can still have a substantial impact. Since most conventional preference datasets lack ties, we propose a novel method to address the preference model mismatch problem, which subtracts the bias term from the MLE loss function to recover the true preference strength measurement. This method can be viewed as a variant of adaptive margin [@touvron2023llama] when training the reward model and a variant of DPO with offset (ODPO) when training DPO [@amini2024direct]. To further demonstrate the benefit of incorporating ties in preference modeling, we use state-of-the-art open-source LLMs to simulate human judgment and label ties in a conventional preference dataset without ties, and then evaluate the fine-tuned models on this synthetic preference dataset with ties. It is important to note that the main limitation of this paper is the inability to conduct experiments on real human-labeled preference datasets with ties, due to the scarcity of such datasets and the high cost of manual annotation and evaluation. Addressing this limitation could be considered for future work.\n\n**Main Contributions.** Our contributions can be outlined as follows:\n\n-   We advocate for the inclusion of tie options when labeling preference data, aligning with human preference habits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose the use of BTT to model human preference.\n\n-   We derive the bias in measuring preference strength caused by model mismatch when assuming the latent preference model is BTT. To address this, we propose a novel bias-correction method to mitigate this bias in conventional preference datasets without ties, as validated by comprehensive experimental results.\n\n-   We generate a synthetic preference dataset with ties, labeled by state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, and evaluate fine-tuning with BTT and BT on this dataset. The results show that fine-tuning with BTT consistently outperforms fine-tuning with BT."},{"heading":"Related Work","text":"# Related Work\n\nThe reward model plays a crucial role in RLHF, guiding LLMs towards objectives aligned with human preferences [@christiano2017deep; @kaufmann2023survey]. Recent related work has addressed various aspects of reward modeling. @wang2024secrets conducted a comprehensive study on reward models, proposing a method to measure the strength of preferences within the data and introducing contrastive learning to enhance the ability of reward models to distinguish between chosen and rejected responses. @zhu2024iterative analyzed reward overfitting and overoptimization problems in RLHF, proposing to mitigate them using an iterative data smoothing method. @dai2023safe proposed training a cost model in addition to the reward model to decouple human preferences regarding helpfulness and harmlessness.\n\nAs a simplified alternative to RLHF, DPO [@rafailov2024direct] has achieved significant success and impact. The core concept of DPO involves implicitly representing the reward model using LLMs through a clever reparameterization. Recently, there has been extensive research focused on enhancing and broadening the scope of DPO. @amini2024direct propose DPO with an offset (ODPO), where the likelihood difference between the preferred and dispreferred response must exceed an offset value. @zhou2023beyond extend DPO for multiple alignment objectives by training LMs as implicit collective reward models, combining all objectives with specific weightings. @chowdhury2024provably propose robust DPO methods to mitigate the bias introduced by noise in preference data on average.\n\nThe preference model serves as the foundation for reflecting human feedback, with the Bradley-Terry (BT) model [@bradley1952rank] being the most commonly used preference model in RLHF. Indeed, various generalized models based on the BT model have been proposed to address different scenarios, such as handling home advantage [@agresti2012categorical], ties [@rao1967ties], multiple comparisons [@plackett1975analysis; @luce2005individual], and team comparisons [@huang2006generalized]. In particular, the Plackett-Luce (PL) model, a popular extension for handling multiple comparisons, has also found application in RLHF [@zhu2023principled; @song2024preference]."},{"heading":"Preliminaries","text":"# Preliminaries\n\n**RLHF** typically comprises three phases: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward learning, and reinforcement learning. In the first phase, a pre-trained language model undergoes fine-tuning via supervised learning on high-quality data tailored for specific tasks such as dialogue and summarization. This fine-tuning process yields the model $\\pi^{\\mathrm{SFT}}$. The second phase involves reward learning on a preference dataset. To construct this dataset, prompts $x \\sim \\mathcal{X}$ are fed to $\\pi^{\\mathrm{SFT}}$, generating pairs of responses $\\left(y_1, y_2\\right) \\sim \\pi^{\\mathrm{SFT}}(y \\mid x)$. These pairs are presented to human labelers, who express preferences. Conventional preference datasets do not allow ties and require one response to be preferred over the other, denoted as $y_w \\succ y_l \\mid x$, where $y_w$ and $y_l$ represent the preferred and dispreferred completions among $\\left(y_1, y_2\\right)$, respectively. The most popular approach to modeling preference is the Bradley-Terry (BT) model, which assumes the human preference distribution $p^*$ as: $$\\label{BT_model}\np^*\\left(y_1 \\succ y_2 \\mid x\\right)=\\frac{\\exp \\left(r^*\\left(x, y_1\\right)\\right)}{\\exp \\left(r^*\\left(x, y_1\\right)\\right)+\\exp \\left(r^*\\left(x, y_2\\right)\\right)} .$$ where $r^*(y, x)$ is the latent reward model which is inaccessible. Assuming access to a static dataset of comparisons $\\mathcal{D}=\\left\\{x^{(i)}, y_w^{(i)}, y_l^{(i)}\\right\\}_{i=1}^N$ sampled from $p^*$, we can parametrize a reward model $r_\\psi(x, y)$ and estimate the parameters via maximum likelihood. Framing the problem as a binary classification we have the negative log-likelihood loss: $$\\mathcal{L}_R\\left(r_\\psi, \\mathcal{D}\\right)=-\\mathbb{E}_{\\left(x, y_w, y_l\\right) \\sim \\mathcal{D}}\\left[\\log \\sigma\\left(r_\\psi\\left(x, y_w\\right)-r_\\psi\\left(x, y_l\\right)\\right)\\right] ,$$ where $\\sigma$ is the logistic function. And the third phase is to solve the following RL problem with the learned reward function: $$\\label{RL_prob}\n    \\max _{\\pi_\\theta} \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim \\mathcal{D}, y \\sim \\pi_\\theta(y \\mid x)}\\left[r_\\psi(x, y)\\right]-\\beta \\mathbb{D}_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\left[\\pi_\\theta(y \\mid x) \\| \\pi^{\\mathrm{SFT}}(y \\mid x)\\right] ,$$ where $\\beta$ is a parameter controlling the deviation from the base reference policy $\\pi^{\\mathrm{SFT}}$.\n\n**DPO** utilizes the fact that the optimization problem [\\[RL_prob\\]](#RL_prob){reference-type=\"eqref\" reference=\"RL_prob\"} has the closed form solution [@go2023aligning; @korbak2022reinforcement; @peng2019advantage; @peters2007reinforcement]: $$\\pi_r(y \\mid x)=\\frac{1}{Z(x)} \\pi^{\\mathrm{SFT}}(y \\mid x) \\exp \\left(\\frac{1}{\\beta} r(x, y)\\right) .$$ Then a clever reparameterization is applied to express the reward function in terms of its corresponding optimal policy $\\pi_r$: $$r(x, y)=\\beta \\log \\frac{\\pi_r(y \\mid x)}{\\pi^{\\mathrm{SFT}}(y \\mid x)}+\\beta \\log Z(x) .$$ Applying this reparameterization to the ground-truth reward $r^*$ and corresponding optimal model $\\pi^*$, then substituting this reparameterization into the BT model [\\[BT_model\\]](#BT_model){reference-type=\"eqref\" reference=\"BT_model\"}, analogous to the reward modeling approach, the loss function of DPO becomes: $$\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{DPO}}\\left(\\pi_\\theta ; \\pi_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)=-\\mathbb{E}_{\\left(x, y_w, y_l\\right) \\sim \\mathcal{D}}\\left[\\log \\sigma\\left(\\beta \\log \\frac{\\pi_\\theta\\left(y_w \\mid x\\right)}{\\pi^{\\mathrm{SFT}}\\left(y_w \\mid x\\right)}-\\beta \\log \\frac{\\pi_\\theta\\left(y_l \\mid x\\right)}{\\pi^{\\mathrm{SFT}}\\left(y_l \\mid x\\right)}\\right)\\right] .$$\n\n**Bradley-Terry model with ties (BTT)** [@rao1967ties] can be employed to model human preference with ties, i.e., the two response $\\left(y_1, y_2\\right) \\sim \\pi^{\\mathrm{SFT}}(y \\mid x)$ are considered equal with respect to the prompt $x$: $$\\begin{aligned}\np_{\\theta}^*\\left(y_1 = y_2 \\mid x \\right)=&\\frac{(\\theta^2 - 1)\\exp \\left(r^*\\left(x, y_1\\right)\\right)\\exp \\left(r^*\\left(x, y_2\\right)\\right)}{\\left(\\exp \\left(r^*\\left(x, y_1\\right)\\right)+ \\theta \\exp \\left(r^*\\left(x, y_2\\right)\\right)\\right)\\left(\\theta \\exp \\left(r^*\\left(x, y_1\\right)\\right)+ \\exp \\left(r^*\\left(x, y_2\\right)\\right)\\right)}\\\\\np_{\\theta}^*\\left(y_1 \\succ y_2 \\mid x\\right)=&\\frac{\\exp \\left(r^*\\left(x, y_1\\right)\\right)}{\\exp \\left(r^*\\left(x, y_1\\right)\\right)+ \\theta \\exp \\left(r^*\\left(x, y_2\\right)\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\theta \\geq 1$ is the parameter controlling the tendency to ties, with a larger $\\theta$ indicating a higher probability of ties occurring.

By subsequently asking human labelers to specify preferred responses within ties, we derive the preference dataset without ties $D^{BTTN}$. Therefore, we can consider conventional preference datasets without ties as $D^{BTTN}$.\n\n## Bias in Measuring Preference Strength\n\nAssuming we have both $D^{BTT}$ and $D^{BTTN}$ derived from $D$, we can illustrate how to estimate the latent reward model using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Since we assume that the latent preference model is BTT and thus obtain the dataset with ties, the most accurate log-likelihood is: $$\\label{LCE_BTT}\n    LCE^{BTT}(r, D) = \\sum_{(x, y_w,y_l) \\in D^{BT}} \\log p_r^{\\theta}(y_w \\succ y_l \\mid x) + \\sum_{(x, y_1,y_2) \\in D^{T}} \\log p_r^{\\theta}(y_1 = y_2 \\mid x)$$ Conventional approaches to estimate the latent reward model typically utilize $D^{BTTN}$ to fit the BT model, with the log-likelihood given by: $$\\label{LCE_BT}\n    LCE^{BT}(r, D) = \\sum_{(x, y_w, y_l) \\in D^{BTTN}} \\log p_r(y_w \\succ y_l \\mid x)$$ We can demonstrate that, even if we possess access to the true prompt and response distributions, there may exist a noteworthy discrepancy between the learned and the actual reward model in measuring preference strength, as illustrated by the following results.\n\nFirst, we can establish the relationship between the true reward model $r^*$ and the learned reward model $\\hat{r}$ by fully optimizing [\\[LCE_BT\\]](#LCE_BT){reference-type=\"eqref\" reference=\"LCE_BT\"} in [2](#relation){reference-type=\"ref+label\" reference=\"relation\"}.\n\n::: {#relation .theorem}\n**Theorem 2**. *$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[LCE^{BT}(r, D)\\right] \\le \\mathbb{E}\\left[LCE^{BT}(\\hat{r}, D)\\right], \\forall r \\neq \\hat{r}$$ where $\\hat{r}$ satisfies $$\\label{r_hat}\n    p_{\\hat{r}}(y_1 \\succ y_2 \\mid x) = q_{r^*}^{\\theta}(y_1 \\succ y_2 \\mid x), \\forall x \\sim \\mathcal{X}, (y_1, y_2) \\sim \\pi^{\\mathrm{SFT}}(y \\mid x)$$ and $$q_r^{\\theta}\\left(y_1 \\succ y_2 \\mid x\\right) = p_r^{\\theta}\\left(y_1 \\succ y_2 \\mid x\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}p_r^{\\theta}\\left(y_1 = y_2 \\mid x\\right)$$*\n:::\n\n::: proof\n*Proof.* By Assumption [1](#ass_rand_label_in_ties){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"ass_rand_label_in_ties\"} we know that the true preference distribution without ties is $q_r^{\\theta}$.

Additionally, the bias term is a sigmoid-shaped function, bounded by $\\log(\\frac{1+\\theta^2}{2 \\theta})$ in absolute value. However, despite this bound, the bias term can still be substantial. As mentioned earlier, @wang2024secrets trained 10 different reward models on the Anthropic's HH-RLHF dataset [@bai2022training], and the mean preference strength of 83.6% of the data falls within the interval $[-0.6, 2.94]$.

Next, we evaluate the average preference bias of these two reward models relative to the ground truth reward under varying preference parameters $\\theta$. The preference bias difference, $\\Delta = |\\Delta r^{BT} - \\Delta r^*| - |\\Delta r^{BTT} - \\Delta r^*|$, is shown in Table [2](#bias_ground_truth){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"bias_ground_truth\"}. From the results, we observe that the preference bias of $r^{BTT}$ is consistently smaller than that of $r^{BT}$, indicating that the BTT model effectively reduces the preference bias with respect to the ground truth reward function, resulting in a more accurate reward model. We also find that as $\\theta$ increases, the preference bias difference becomes larger, which aligns with the trends shown in [1](#bias_fig){reference-type=\"ref+label\" reference=\"bias_fig\"}, as a larger $\\theta$ in ground truth preference model indicates a higher probability of ties occurring.\n\n::: {#bias_ground_truth}\n  -------------- -------------- ---------------\n  $\\theta = 2$   $\\theta = 5$   $\\theta = 10$\n  0.0206         0.0237         0.0353\n  -------------- -------------- ---------------\n\n  : The preference bias difference between $r^{BT}$ and $r^{BTT}$\n:::\n\n## DPO With a Bias-Correction Offset\n\nWe apply Alg. [\\[alg1\\]](#alg1){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"alg1\"} to the conventional preference dataset without ties, Anthropic's HH-RLHF, in order to mitigate the bias term using a DPO reward model. It is important to note that this approach can be viewed as a variant of the ODPO method [@amini2024direct], with the key difference being the bias-correction term. We train the small Pythia-160M model [@biderman2023pythia] for one epoch and record the reward preference accuracy on the test set. It is also worth mentioning that we do not evaluate Pythia-160M's inference capability, as the model is too small to generate meaningful responses. The experimental results are presented in [3](#exp_odpo){reference-type=\"ref+label\" reference=\"exp_odpo\"}. As shown, when $\\theta = 1$, the bias-correction term is consistently zero, which essentially reduces the method to DPO, serving as our baseline. From [3](#exp_odpo){reference-type=\"ref+label\" reference=\"exp_odpo\"}, we observe that all three ODPO methods, with $\\theta \\in \\{2, 5, 10\\}$, significantly outperform DPO, with ODPO at $\\theta = 5$ showing more than a $10\\%$ improvement in accuracy.\n\n::: {#exp_odpo}\n  -------------- -------------- -------------- ---------------\n  $\\theta = 1$   $\\theta = 2$   $\\theta = 5$   $\\theta = 10$\n  0.5333         0.5583         0.6042         0.5958\n  -------------- -------------- -------------- ---------------\n\n  : Test Accuracy of DPO with a bias-Correction offset\n:::\n\nTo further validate the effectiveness of Alg [\\[alg1\\]](#alg1){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"alg1\"}, we fine-tuned the larger Pythia-2.8B model [@biderman2023pythia] on the HH-RLHF dataset using DPO and DPO with a bias-correction offset, and evaluated their responses using Llama and Qwen. Due to limited computing resources, we only conducted experiments for the optimal $\\theta$, i.e., 5, as indicated in [3](#exp_odpo){reference-type=\"ref+label\" reference=\"exp_odpo\"}. The results, shown in [4](#odpo_winrate){reference-type=\"ref+label\" reference=\"odpo_winrate\"}, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms DPO, confirming the effectiveness of the preference strength bias-correction offset. It is important to note that we provide evaluators with the option to label ties, and Llama and Qwen may occasionally refuse to evaluate certain offensive content. Therefore, we only include samples that are clearly evaluated as wins or losses when calculating the win rate.\n\n::: {#odpo_winrate}\n  ----------- -------- --------\n  Evaluator   Llama    Qwen\n  Win rate    0.5582   0.5370\n  ----------- -------- --------\n\n  : Win rate of DPO with a bias-correction offset against DPO\n:::\n\n## Synthetic Preference Datasets with Ties\n\nThe most compelling experiment is to fine-tune two models using BT and BTT, respectively, on a real preference dataset with ties and then compare their win rates. However, due to the lack of human-labeled preference datasets with ties and the high cost of manual annotation and evaluation, we use an LLM to simulate human judgment and label ties in Anthropic's HH-RLHF dataset. We then fine-tune Pythia-2.8B [@biderman2023pythia] on this synthetic preference dataset with ties, applying the BT and BTT preference models, and evaluate the responses. When using the loss function [\\[LCE_BTT\\]](#LCE_BTT){reference-type=\"ref\" reference=\"LCE_BTT\"}, we refer to this approach as TDPO. To reduce bias, we utilize Llama and Qwen, alternately as labelers and evaluators. The two labeled preference datasets are summarized in [5](#tied_dataset){reference-type=\"ref+label\" reference=\"tied_dataset\"}.\n\n::: {#tied_dataset}\n  -------------------- ------- ------\n  labeler              Llama   Qwen\n  \\# of tied samples   847     3553\n  -------------------- ------- ------\n\n  : Summary of preference datasets with ties\n:::\n\n<figure id=\"fig:win_rate_vs_ties_ratio\">\n<p><img src=\"win_rate_vs_ties_ratio.png\" style=\"width:100.0%\" alt=\"image\" /> <span id=\"fig:win_rate_vs_ties_ratio\" data-label=\"fig:win_rate_vs_ties_ratio\"></span></p>\n<figcaption>TDPO win rate against DPO with varying ties sample ratio in preference dataset</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWe observe that Anthropic's HH-RLHF dataset contains over $160k$ samples, with only a small portion labeled as ties. As a result, directly fine-tuning LLMs on the entire labeled dataset would lead to minimal impact from the tied samples. To emphasize the importance of these tied samples, we train DPO and TDPO on preference datasets with varying percentages of tied samples, with untied samples randomly selected. We still only conducted experiments for the optimal $\\theta$, i.e., $5$, due to limited computing resources. The win rate results are presented in [2](#fig:win_rate_vs_ties_ratio){reference-type=\"ref+label\" reference=\"fig:win_rate_vs_ties_ratio\"}. From the results, we observe that, regardless of the labeler and evaluator, the win rate of TDPO increases as the number of tied samples increases, and it significantly exceeds $50\\%$ when only tied samples are present. This demonstrates that incorporating BTT with tied samples improves the quality of the trained reward model. Moreover, as shown in [2](#fig:win_rate_vs_ties_ratio){reference-type=\"ref+label\" reference=\"fig:win_rate_vs_ties_ratio\"}, when Llama is the labeler and Qwen is the evaluator, the win rate of TDPO consistently exceeds $50\\%$ when the tie ratio is greater than $0.2$. In contrast, when Qwen is the labeler and Llama is the evaluator, TDPO's performance is slightly lower. This may be due to Qwen's less strict criteria for ties, resulting in an overabundance of tied samples."},{"heading":"Discussion","text":"# Discussion\n\nIn this paper, we introduced the concept of incorporating ties into preference modeling. Specifically, we applied the generalized Bradley-Terry model---the Bradley-Terry model with ties---to more accurately capture human preferences. Additionally, we analyzed the bias in measuring preference strength due to model mismatch and proposed a novel method to mitigate this bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of considering ties in preference modeling. A limitation of this work is the absence of real human-annotated preference datasets with ties, as collecting such data is both expensive and time-consuming. Future work involving human-labeled preference datasets with ties could significantly improve the effectiveness of preference modeling."},{"heading":"Acknowledgements","text":"# Acknowledgements {#acknowledgements .unnumbered}\n\nThis research is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) \\[Grant NSFC-72225009, 72394360, 72394365\\]."},{"heading":"Proof of [3](#main_theorem)","text":"# Proof of [3](#main_theorem){reference-type=\"ref+label\" reference=\"main_theorem\"} {#proof-of-main_theorem}\n\n::: proof\n*Proof.* []{#proof_main_theorem label=\"proof_main_theorem\"} From [\\[r_hat\\]](#r_hat){reference-type=\"eqref\" reference=\"r_hat\"}, we can know that: $$\\begin{aligned}\n            p_{\\hat{r}}(y_1 \\succ y_2 \\mid x) = &p_{r^*}^{\\theta}(y_1 \\succ y_2 \\mid x) + \\frac{1}{2}p_{r^*}^{\\theta}(y_1 = y_2 \\mid x)\\\\\n            p_{\\hat{r}}(y_2 \\succ y_1 \\mid x) = &p_{r^*}^{\\theta}(y_2 \\succ y_1 \\mid x) + \\frac{1}{2}p_{r^*}^{\\theta}(y_2 = y_1 \\mid x)\\\\\n        \\end{aligned}$$ By subtraction, we can get: $$p_{\\hat{r}}(y_1 \\succ y_2 \\mid x) -

The Bradley-Terry (BT) model stands as the prevalent choice for capturing human preferences from datasets containing pairs of chosen and rejected responses. In preference modeling, the focus is not on absolute values but rather on the reward difference between chosen and rejected responses, referred to as preference strength. Thus, precise evaluation of preference strength holds paramount importance in preference modeling. However, an easily overlooked factor significantly affecting preference strength measurement is that human attitudes towards two responses may not solely indicate a preference for one over the other and ties are also a common occurrence.","target":"To address this, we propose the adoption of the generalized Bradley-Terry model -- the Bradley-Terry model with ties (BTT) -- to accommodate tied preferences, thus leveraging additional information. We prove that even with the access to the true distributions of prompt and response, disregarding ties can lead to a notable bias in preference strength measurement. Comprehensive experiments further validate the advantages of incorporating ties in preference modeling. Notably, fine-tuning with BTT significantly outperforms fine-tuning with BT on synthetic preference datasets with ties, labeled by state-of-the-art open-source LLMs."}]
