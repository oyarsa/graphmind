# scripts: independent scripts

This directory is a collection of (potentially) throwaway scripts I write over the
course of development that could be useful again in the future, so I don't want to just
delete them.

Every script will include a docstring describing what they do and their context, but I
make no promises about structure. However, they should still pass the check task,
including ruff checks and pyright. It's acceptable that these scripts use `pyright:
basic`, although they should still have _some_ form of typing.
